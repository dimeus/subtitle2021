1
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,010
Long time no see, Okkotsu.

2
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,810
Don't come near me.

3
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,940
Oh, come on, don't be so cold.

4
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,570
I said don't.

5
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,570
I said don't.

6
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,230
Do you know how much 
I've wanted to slug you?

7
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,700
Just imagine how I've felt.

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,490
Right?

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,950
Stop it.

10
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,620
Stop it.

11
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,200
If you keep me on edge like this, 
I might just kill you.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Don't come near me!

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Rika-chan!

14
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,670
Huh? Rika?

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Record: November 2016, Tokyo
Due to persistent bullying by classmates,
four male students, including the leader, suffered grave injuries.

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,640
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,180
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,970
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,730
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,960
A complete cover-up and a secret execution?

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,920
That's ridiculous.

24
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,010
The boy in question consented, though.

25
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,210
He's underage.

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,590
Just a 16-year-old child.

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,220
We also don't know how 
many he'd curse to death.

28
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,810
He's already turned the tables 
on three grade 2 sorcerers

29
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,580
and a grade 1 sorcerer.

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,650
That's why you've turned to me.

31
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,320
Have you forgotten that?

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,320
Then you're actually...

33
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,780
Yes.

34
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,320
Okkotsu Yuta...

35
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,210
will be taken to Jujutsu High.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,170
What is this,

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,750
Okkotsu Yuta-kun?

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,510
It used to be a knife.

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,760
I tried to die,

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,440
but Rika-chan interfered.

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,050
That's dark.

42
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,440
You're starting at a new school today.

43
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,700
I'm not going.

44
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,570
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore,

45
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,080
so I'm not going outside anymore.

46
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,160
But...

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,790
living by yourself gets lonely.

48
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,470
The curse placed upon you

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,220
is one that can save people, too, 
depending on how it's used.

50
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,220
{\an8}Tokyo
Jujutsu High School

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,590
Learn how to use that power.

52
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,930
It's not like it'll be too late

53
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,390
to cast everything away after that.

54
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,930
JUJUTSU KAISEN

55
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:22,980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

56
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,700
Did you hear about the 
transfer student coming today?

57
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,530
They say he "stuffed" four of 
his classmates into a locker.

58
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,570
He killed them?

59
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,700
Tuna mayo?

60
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,120
No, but gravely injured, apparently.

61
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,330
Hmm... Well, if he's cocky, I'll wring him out.

62
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,750
Bonito flakes.

63
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,220
I'll now... be introducing... 
the transfer student!

64
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,220
Everyone, get excited!

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,220
Get excited.

66
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,730
I heard he's an awfully sour one.

67
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,810
I'm not going to create the mood 
for someone like that.

68
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,140
Salmon.

69
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,610
Oh, well.

70
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,740
Come on in!

71
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
I sense a really damp mood in there.

72
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,500
I'll ignore him.

73
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,890
Wha?!

74
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm Okkotsu Yut—

75
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,310
Is this some kind of test?

76
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,570
Hey.

77
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,820
You're cursed.

78
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,660
This is a place to learn curses.

79
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,750
It's not a place for the cursed to be.

80
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,450
Huh?

81
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,370
The number of people that die 
mysterious deaths or go missing

82
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,920
in Japan is over 10,000 a year on average.

83
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,000
Most of those are casualties of curses

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,880
born from the negative emotions of people.

85
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,680
Among them are also malicious 
cases caused by curse users.

86
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,850
Only curses can affect other curses.

87
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,320
This where we learn curses 
to exorcise curses:

88
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,820
Tokyo Jujutsu High School.

89
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,310
Tell me that ahead of time!

90
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,450
He just now told him that?!

91
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,450
Sorry.

92
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,200
Oh, you all should back away quickly.

93
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,420
Do not...

94
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Wait! Rika-chan!

95
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,850
...bully Yuta!

96
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,850
Special-Grade Cursed Human Okkotsu Yuta

Special-Grade Cursed Apparition Orimoto Rika

97
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,850
Record: Six Years Ago, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture

98
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,230
Over there, over there!

99
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,400
What is it?

100
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,240
Happy birthday, Yuta.

101
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,120
Yay! Can I open it?

102
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,330
Go ahead.

103
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,250
Huh? I can open it?!

104
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,420
I said go ahead.

105
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,790
Wow!

106
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,170
Huh? A ring?

107
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,470
An engagement ring.

108
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,680
Engagement?

109
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,310
It's a promise.

110
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,770
That when we both grow up, 
we'll get married.

111
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,820
Is this real?!

112
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,200
Hey!

113
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,290
Hey! Call an ambulance!

114
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,290
Idiot! Look at her!

115
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,290
{\an8}Are they okay?

116
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,170
There's no saving her!

117
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,540
{\an8}What happened?

118
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,960
Her head's crushed in!

119
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,290
But still...

120
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,550
A child got run over by a car! Yes! Hurry!

121
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,720
{\an8}Help them!

122
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,510
I can't go near that!

123
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,300
Rika-chan?

124
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,770
Yuta...

125
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,570
Yuta.

126
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,950
When we grow up,

127
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,750
we'll get married!

128
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,270
It's a promise.

129
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,930
So as you can see,

130
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,590
this is the boy cursed by Rika-chan, 
who just <i>loves</i> him...

131
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,680
Okkotsu Yuta-kun!

132
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,350
Be nice to him, everyone!

133
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,560
If you attack Yuta, Rika-chan's 
curse will activate... or not.

134
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,530
Either way, be careful, everyone.

135
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,150
Say that sooner.

136
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,900
These guys are being all rebellious,

137
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
so I'll introduce them quick-like.

138
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,290
I have a feeling this teacher is the problem.

139
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,330
This is the cursed tool user, Zen'in Maki.

140
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,160
She uses special tools to exorcise curses.

141
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,970
This is the cursed 
speech user, Inumaki Toge.

142
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,050
He can only speak in rice ball ingredients, 
so good luck conversing.

143
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,420
Kelp.

144
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,630
This is Panda.

145
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm Panda. Nice to meet you.

146
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,810
Well, there you have it.

147
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,890
He didn't give me the 
explanation I wanted most!

148
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,020
Okay, now there are four first-years!

149
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,820
Three and one animal.

150
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,280
For your afternoon jujutsu practice,

151
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,900
you'll be in pairs of two on two.

152
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,940
Toge, Panda, pair up.

153
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,910
Let's do our best.

154
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Maki, Yuta, pair up.

155
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,250
Geh!

156
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,370
She just voiced disgust?!

157
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,380
U-Um, I-I hope we can work together.

158
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,640
You were bullied, weren't you?

159
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,930
Bull's-eye, huh?

160
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,570
I totally get it. Even I'd bully you.

161
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,940
Maybe it's because of your curse?

162
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,780
It's written on your face that you're 
branding yourself as a good person.

163
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,690
It's sickening.

164
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,990
Why are you acting like the victim 
when you're being protected?

165
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,950
You've been passive your 
whole life, haven't you?

166
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,950
Jujutsu High isn't so easy that

167
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,090
you can get by without any goal.

168
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,840
Maki!

169
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,380
That's enough!

170
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,750
Bonito flakes.

171
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,680
Okay, fine. Get off my case.

172
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,850
Sorry about her.

173
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,560
She has a habit of acting
like she understands others.

174
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
No...

175
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,150
She's right.

176
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,020
Where are we?

177
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,950
It's just an elementary school.

178
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,620
Huh?

179
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,660
Just an elementary school where 
some children have gone missing.

180
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,700
Missing?!

181
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,880
It happens in places like this.

182
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,590
It's probably the work of 
a naturally-occurring curse.

183
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,000
You're saying the kids 
were kidnapped by a curse?

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
Yup.

185
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,850
Two so far.

186
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,930
Curses tend to settle in spots

187
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,940
that many people have memories of.

188
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,150
Schools, hospitals...

189
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,520
Places often remembered with negative 
emotions are a receptacle for them.

190
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,110
As those emotions build up,

191
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,660
they cause a curse to be born, 
like it was here.

192
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,370
We're here to exorcise the curse 
and save the children,

193
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,030
or if they're dead, retrieve them.

194
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,490
Huh? Dead?

195
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,540
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

196
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,790
Purify that which is impure.

197
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,640
It's turning into night?

198
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,640
It's a veil.

199
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,510
It's a barrier that will smoke out the curse

200
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,970
and keep you all from 
being seen by those outside.

201
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,810
It's easy to undo from inside.

202
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,900
Now, do be careful...

203
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,160
not to die.

204
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,820
D-Die? Sensei?!

205
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,360
Transfer student.

206
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,410
Don't get distracted.

207
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,850
Put... me... on?

208
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,380
Put me on?

209
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,380
I-It's coming this way!

210
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,300
Wh-Wh-What do we do?!

211
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,640
Don't scream.

212
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
Remember this.

213
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,060
The weaker curses are,

214
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,360
the more they group together.

215
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,490
Of course, the same could be said for humans.

216
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,330
Incredible...

217
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,000
Just one blow...

218
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,660
Come on, let's move it.

219
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,370
Huh? Where to?

220
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,670
Inside, obviously.

221
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Zen'in-san, aren't you scared?

222
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,480
Don't use my last name.

223
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,520
S-Sorry...

224
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,170
But it really seems like 
ghosts would be here.

225
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,440
Though we've already seen some.

226
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,440
There aren't many curses here, 
even though the veil's been drawn.

227
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,120
No, they're here, just not attacking.

228
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,370
Is it because he's here?

229
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,370
Something just moved!

230
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,760
Hey!

231
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,670
Yes?!

232
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,260
What grade are you?

233
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,260
Huh? In English proficiency?

234
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,850
Jujutsu sorcerers are ranked 
in grades from 4 to 1.

235
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,520
But I only just came to Jujutsu High.

236
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't think I have that.

237
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,560
Ugh, forget it.

238
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,410
Show me your student ID.

239
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,530
You got one from that 
dumb blindfolded guy, right?

240
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,530
Dumb blindfolded guy?

241
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,280
Yes, here you go.

242
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,290
Well, if you joined with no prior history, 
you're probably grade 4...

243
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870
{\an1}Tokyo Jujutsu High School              [Student ID]

244
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870


245
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870
{\an5}Special

246
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870
{\an1}Student ID #

247
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870
{\an1}Name         Okkotsu Yuta

248
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870
{\an1}DOB: 03/07/2001

249
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,870
{\an1}This is proof that the individual listed above is a student.

250
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,160
Special-grade?!

251
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,620
Special-grade is above 
even grade 1, isn't it?

252
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,960
This sounds like it has to be a joke!

253
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,960
Zen'in-san!

254
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,880
Zen'in-san! Zen'in-san!

255
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,500
Behind you.

256
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,480
Shit!

257
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,190
You're way too damn big!

258
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,770
You bastard!

259
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:49,750
Thank, thank, thank you for the meal!

260
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,590
Shit! Shit!

261
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,250
I dropped my cursed tool!

262
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,340
Let us out, damn it!

263
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,680
Where are we?

264
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,470
We're in that curse's stomach!

265
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,410
You shouldn't be passing out over this.

266
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,720
You mean it ate us?!

267
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,150
That's right!

268
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,060
I thought you were being 
protected by your curse?!

269
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,980
Even I don't know what 
makes Rika-chan come out!

270
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,060
More importantly, what do we do now?!

271
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,320
After time passes and the veil 
goes away, help will come for us.

272
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,700
This is embarrassing! Shit!

273
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,320
Help!

274
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,950
Huh?

275
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,140
Please! He's about to die!

276
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,040
You're saying the kids 
were kidnapped by a curse?

277
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,050
Yup.

278
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,890
Two so far.

279
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,760
We're here to exorcise the curse 
and save the children,

280
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,430
or if they're dead, retrieve them.

281
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,650
Thank goodness they're alive.

282
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,020
No, it's not good.

283
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,900
Look closer.

284
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,440
The big one's obviously been  
affected by the curse, too.

285
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,740
Both of them could die at any minute.

286
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,450
Oh, no...

287
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,110
What do we do?!

288
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,740
There's nothing we can do!

289
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,860
We can only wait for help!

290
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,580
Not everyone has a resistance 
to curses like you do!

291
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,420
Zen'in-san?

292
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,210
Zen'in-san?!

293
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,510
What's this wound?

294
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,800
Are you cursed?

295
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,730
Is she going to die?

296
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,600
Please, save us, mister!

297
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,570
Please!

298
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,450
You keep asking, but I can't—

299
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,700
Okkotsu!

300
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,620
Seriously, why did you come

301
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,040
to Jujutsu High?!

302
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,250
What do you want to do?!

303
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,710
What do you want to have?! 
What do you want to achieve?!

304
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,300
I... don't want anyone to get hurt anymore.

305
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,660
I tried to lock myself away and disappear.

306
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,980
But I was told it's 
lonely being all by myself,

307
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,020
and I couldn't argue.

308
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,810
I want to interact with someone!

309
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,320
I want to be needed by someone!

310
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,360
I want the confidence to 
say it's okay that I'm alive!

311
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,190
Then exorcise them.

312
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,790
Exorcise curses, exorcise them, 
exorcise them over and over!

313
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,790
Confidence and friends will 
all come to you after that!

314
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,260
That's the kind of place Jujutsu High is!

315
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,060
Rika-chan.

316
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,730
What?

317
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,690
Lend me your strength.

318
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,550
Who are you?

319
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,760
Be quiet!

320
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,890
Now that's terrifying.

321
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,940
So this is the full picture of Orimoto Rika,

322
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,070
the special-grade cursed apparition?

323
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,900
So scary.

324
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,020
Wow!

325
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,950
So pretty!

326
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,990
I'm so pretty!

327
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,620
I love it!

328
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,880
Everyone...

329
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,000
It's just a little further!

330
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,430
I need to get Sensei to check them all soon,

331
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,220
while Rika-chan's distracting the curses!

332
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,230
I can't collapse yet!

333
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,490
Not yet!

334
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,880
I just decided I was going 
to change, here and now!

335
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,330
You can do it,

336
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,360
Yuta.

337
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,480
Yeah, I will!

338
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,350
Welcome back.

339
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
You did well.

340
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,110
They say both Maki and the kids will be fine.

341
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,200
Thank goodness.

342
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,620
You don't look very satisfied.

343
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,250
I managed to call Rika-chan 
out myself for the first time.

344
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,250
Really? That's a step forward.

345
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,300
One, two...

346
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,510
Stop, Yuta!

347
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,180
I said stop!

348
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,480
Stop, Rika-chan!

349
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,900
There! Take that!

350
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,910
It's a promise.

351
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,910
When we both grow up, we'll get married.

352
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Sure!

353
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,710
Then we'll be together forever and ever!

354
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,970
What's wrong?

355
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,100
Nothing...

356
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,350
Just remembering something.

357
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,320
I don't think Rika-chan cursed me.

358
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,360
I think I might have cursed Rika-chan.

359
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,030
This is my personal theory,

360
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,350
but there's no curse more twisted than love.

361
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,590
Sensei.

362
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,250
While I'm at Jujutsu High,

363
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,500
I'll break Rika-chan's curse.

364
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,490
The special-grade cursed 
apparition, Orimoto Rika,

365
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,580
was fully manifested for 422 seconds.

366
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,750
We entrusted you with Okkotsu 
precisely to prevent this sort of thing.

367
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,090
There's no room for excuses,

368
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,290
Gojo Satoru.

369
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,500
Well, I never planned on making any excuses.

370
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,380
How can you joke about this?!

371
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,010
If Orimoto Rika had remained out of control,

372
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,600
she could have wiped out an entire town!

373
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,600
I would have risked my life to stop her.

374
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,610
Listen, there's only one thing 
we can say about that curse:

375
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,610
"I don't understand."

376
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,440
Why did a little girl who wasn't 
from any line of jujutsu sorcerers

377
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,910
become such an immense curse?

378
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,320
We can't control something 
we don't understand.

379
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,920
So it'll take trial and error.

380
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Just leave it alone for a while.

381
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,500
Do not forget that Okkotsu's 
secret execution was only suspended.

382
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,510
And don't you forget

383
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,840
that if it comes to that, 
I'll side with Okkotsu.

384
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,020
Christ, damn rude geezers.

385
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,230
I don't ever want to become like them.

386
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,730
I'll have to be careful.

387
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,700
Besides,

388
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,410
no one's allowed to take 
youth away from young people.

389
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,750
Maki, Toge, last lap.

390
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,580
No one is.

391
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,520
Well, go ahead.

392
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,190
S-Sure...

393
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,750
It's nearly impossible to exorcise 
a curse as big as Orimoto Rika.

394
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,460
However, breaking it is a different story.

395
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,960
You have to read the thousands, maybe 
tens of thousands, of knots of cursed energy,

396
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,330
and unravel them one by one.

397
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,090
It's a method that can only be pursued 
by you, the one she's cursed.

398
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,550
What exactly do I do?

399
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,340
Use this.

400
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,100
A katana?

401
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,770
Curses are most stable when 
they're possessing an object.

402
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,240
Back then, you used that ring 
to connect to Orimoto Rika.

403
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,770
The pipeline's already there.

404
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
So now you need to borrow part of Rika's curse,

405
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,610
imbue it into the katana, and control it.

406
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,080
Increase the amount as you repeat it,

407
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,830
and eventually you'll have 
all of it under your control.

408
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,750
Then you're free.

409
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,710
Both you and her.

410
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,800
Imbue the curse into the katana...

411
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,630
And at the same time...

412
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,920
You need to learn how to wield a blade!

413
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,060
You're super weak, after all.

414
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,220
First, we'll have to train you thoroughly.

415
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,340
Tuna.

416
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,070
Hey, hey, everyone!

417
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,660
How's it going?

418
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,580
Oh, uh...

419
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,280
Don't get distracted.

420
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Right.

421
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,910
Take your stance already, idiot!

422
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,120
She's ruthless!

423
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,590
Right!

424
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,090
You're going to land a 
blow on me, aren't you?

425
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,590
Yes!

426
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,310
She dodged that?!

427
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,360
But she's off-balance!

428
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,400
I'll get her on the landing!

429
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,030
No way!

430
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,660
There, you're dead.

431
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,170
I win again.

432
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,670
Was that last part necessary?

433
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,380
Don't be soft.

434
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,540
You should always treat 
it like it's a real battle.

435
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,680
Pain or the lack thereof makes a 
huge difference in how fast you grow.

436
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,680
That's right. I'm...

437
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,350
One more, please!

438
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,190
I'm going to break Rika-chan's curse!

439
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,660
It's been three months since 
Yuta came to Jujutsu High.

440
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,110
His movements have gotten a lot better.

441
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,950
Salmon.

442
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,700
His personality is more positive now, too.

443
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,660
Salmon roe.

444
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,870
Maki looks like she's having fun, too.

445
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,000
Before now, she didn't get to spar 
much with a fellow weapon—

446
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,670
Revelation!

447
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,930
Yuta! Hey, come here!

448
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,510
Come on!

449
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,180
Huh?

450
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,430
What's up, Panda-kun?

451
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,690
A super important discussion! Listen closely!

452
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Do you prefer big boobs or small boobs?

453
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,690
Right now?!

454
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,690
I've never really given it much thought...

455
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:13,700
Sexy Talk

456
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,820
But I suppose I prefer them somewhat big?

457
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,700
Oh-ho?

458
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,450
Maki!

459
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,450
Huh?

460
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,280
You've got a chance!

461
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,710
Chance! Chance! Chance!

462
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,960
What crazy ideas are you getting? 
I'll kill you!

463
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,620
Don't be so shy! 
Are you an elementary schooler?

464
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,210
{\an8}All right, I'll kill you!

465
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,220
{\an8}I don't give a damn about CITES!

466
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,220
What's this about?

467
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,050
Kelp.

468
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,230
I still don't really understand Inumaki-kun,

469
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
so he's a little scary...

470
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,020
Okay, gather round!

471
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,610
You two, continue your training.

472
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,030
Toge, you've been requested.

473
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,240
It's a curse you're perfect for.

474
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,990
Go exorcise it quickly.

475
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,030
Salmon.

476
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,250
Requested?

477
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,200
Toge's the only grade 2 
sorcerer among us first-years.

478
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,790
He's allowed to take missions on his own.

479
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,700
Wow, that's impressive.

480
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,300
You're a special-grade.

481
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,550
You go with him, Yuta.

482
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,050
You'll be Toge's support.

483
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,420
Huh? Support?

484
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,590
Well, more like an observer, really.

485
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,850
There's a wide variety of jujutsu,

486
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,270
so you can assume there are as many ways 
to exorcise a curse as there are sorcerers.

487
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,060
Toge's cursed speech is one good example.

488
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,070
Make sure to learn from him.

489
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,360
Cursed speech?

490
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,320
As the term suggests, 
it's imbuing speech with curses.

491
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,820
Well, it'll make sense once you see it.

492
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,660
To break a curse, 
you must first understand curses.

493
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,160
My first real mission...

494
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,620
No, my second.

495
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,990
I'm so nervous!

496
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
Salmon.

497
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,840
Huh?!

498
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,050
Oh, I-I'm sorry...

499
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,090
Yuta, one second.

500
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,710
Yes?

501
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,470
Sorry, I won't be able to 
supervise this time.

502
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,760
But the job is one Toge could 
typically handle on his own,

503
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,930
so you can take it easy.

504
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,900
There's only one thing 
you need to be careful of.

505
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,730
Don't let Rika out.

506
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,540
There's no guarantee she'll go back 
in like she luckily did last time.

507
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,940
Only use what power of Rika's 
that you can imbue in your sword.

508
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,830
If you let her out fully again...

509
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,330
If I let her out?

510
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,340
You and I will both be killed!

511
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,750
Counting on you.

512
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,880
Wha...

513
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,890
Why does he have to rub salt 
in that wound right now?!

514
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,360
We've arrived.

515

516
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,110
Hapina Shopping District.

517
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,370
At this time, most of the 
shutters here are closed.

518
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,370
Authorized Personnel Only
No Trespassing

519
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,370
<font color="#21200e" size="14">We're
closed.</font>

520
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:11,250
"There's a project to demolish the entire 
area and attract a shopping mall."

521
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,040
"During an inspection of the area,
we confirmed a pack of low-level curses."

522
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,530
"We'd like to request that the grade 2 
sorcerer, Inumaki, exorcise them."

523
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,050
Huh? Wait, where's sorcerer Inumaki?

524
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,760
Not here?

525
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,970
Thank you.

526
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,310
Oh, Ijichi-san, over there.

527
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,060
He was shopping?

528
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,980
What did you buy?

529
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,570
<font color="#4b4b4e" size="10" face="Comic">Throat Remedy</font>

530
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,570
Throat medicine?

531
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,220
In short, it would cause all 
kinds of issues down the road

532
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,880
if the building they're spending so 
much money on developed a bad history,

533
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,490
so they want us to exorcise it now.

534
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,580
Salmon.

535
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,540
Now, I'll draw the veil.

536
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
Good luck.

537
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,270
He said it was a pack of low-level curses.

538
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,350
Pollack roe.

541
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,770
That's not fair, Mama.

542
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,250
Onii-chan got more.

543
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,250
So what? Let's trade doubles.

544
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,250
I smell olives.

545
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,960
I want to eat sushi!

546
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,720
Reporting a lost child.

547
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,260
Cheap stuff! Cheap stuff!

548
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
It's not scary if you cross with everyone.

549
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,850
The weaker curses are, 
the more they group together.

550
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:55,020
Even so, there's just too many of them!

551
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,490
Inumaki-kun?!

552
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,150
It's dangerous if you get that clo—

553
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,150
Explode.

554
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,910
This is cursed speech?

555
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,800
Huh? Oh... It's over already?

556
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,380
Tuna mayo.

557
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,300
His voice is really worn out!

558
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,460
Oh, that explains the throat medicine.

559
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,060
That's an incredible power,

560
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,270
but it comes with a good deal of risk, too.

561
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,110
Bonito flakes...

562
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,030
What's wrong?

563
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,230
Huh? You're right.

564
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,700
The veil isn't lifting.

565
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,730
Huh?

566
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,000
We won't be able to get out.

567
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,980
What is this curse? Its presence is 
nothing like the ones from before...

568
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,460
Zomba.

569
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,130
Inumaki-kun!

570
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,600
Twist!

571
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,070
What, what, what?! What is that?!

572
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,160
That curse...

573
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,830
He said they'd be low-level!

574
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,370
This isn't what we were told!

575
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,700
There's that thing's size, too.

576
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,050
It's way scarier than the big guys
from the elementary school.

577
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,090
That's right!

578
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,750
Inumaki-kun, you're hurt.

579
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,220
Is your finger all right?

580
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,720
Wow, that looks painful.

581
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,970
Salmon.

582
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
You shouldn't mess with it!

583
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,730
Sorry.

584
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,900
It's my fault.

585
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,410
It doesn't seem to be pursuing 
us or searching for us.

586
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,280
I'll contact Ijichi-san.

587
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,300
{\an5}No Service

588
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,300
{\an5}Enter Your Passcode

589
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,300
Out of service?

590
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,750
But why?

591
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,040
Bonito flakes.

592
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,630
Huh?

593
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,420
Because of the veil?

594
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,080
If the veil won't lift,

595
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,430
then we have to exorcise it, right?

596
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,380
Inumaki-kun?

597
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,360
Should you be moving around already?

598
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,140
Kelp.

599
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,220
You're going to go alone?

600
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,600
Thank you, Inumaki-kun.

601
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,000
But I'm all right.

602
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,030
Let's both do our best together!

603
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,830
Oh?

604
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,370
Get him, Yuta!

605
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,510
It's mad?! Why?!

606
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,340
It was already scary enough!

607
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,480
Don't take your eyes off him.

608
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,810
Don't stop moving.

609
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,980
Imbue the curse into the katana.

610
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,640
Inumaki-kun is kind.

611
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,670
He doesn't want to 
accidentally curse others,

612
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,130
so he speaks in rice ball components—
words that can't carry curses.

613
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,760
Even today, he helped me out.

614
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,300
He tried to keep me away from danger.

615
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,060
Even back then,

616
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,560
he was showing consideration 
for my anxiety, wasn't he?

617
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,940
Zora.

618
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,610
That was shallow!

619
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,110
And he's tough!

620
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,540
I still can't compete with this curse, but...

621
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,300
Inumaki-kun!

622
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:19,130
I'll make sure to respond 
to Inumaki-kun's kindness!

623
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,150
Get crushed!

624
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,830
Wow!

625
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,950
Mustard leaf!

626
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,250
Oh, I'm fine.

627
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,540
It's only a scratch.

628
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,160
Salmon.

629
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,190
Yeah, good work!

630
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,550
Once I break Rika-chan's curse,

631
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,170
I'll be a normal person.

632
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,190
I won't be able to stay 
at Jujutsu High anymore,

633
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,630
but until then,

634
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,160
I want to be useful to everyone.

635
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,950
Oh, what do we do about the veil?

636
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,950
What a shame.

637
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,450
I came here to see this rumored Rika-chan.

638
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,670
As a fellow special-grade,
I was hoping to meet her soon.

639
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,290
Tokyo Jujutsu High School                [Student ID]

640
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,290


641
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,290
Special

642
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,290
Student ID #

643
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,290
Name            Okkotsu Yuta

644
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,290
DOB: 03/07/2001

645
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,290
This is proof that the individual listed above is a student.

646
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,410
I needed to deliver 
something he dropped, too.

647
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,470
Toge's cursed speech

648
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,310
is something he's been able 
to use since he was born,

649
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,850
so back in the day, he struggled quite a bit.

650
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:58,850
Sometimes he cursed people 
he never intended to curse.

651
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,900
His situation was rather similar to yours.

652
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:06,610
That's why he's been worried about you 
since the day you transferred in.

653
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,670
It's easy to misunderstand him,

654
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,490
but he's a good guy.

655
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,590
I hope you'll be kind to him.

656
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,480
Yeah, I'll—

657
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,540
Come on, let's start morning training!

658
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,220
Oh, right.

659
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,010
Panda! What are you laughing about?!

660
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,090
I'll kill you!

661
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,260
Huh? It's nothing, though.

662
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,340
Maki-san, hey...

663
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,060
I'd like to imbue my curse

664
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,100
into my katana more smoothly. 
Do you know any tricks?

665
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,940
Nope.

666
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,560
Don't ask me about cursed energy.

667
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,780
I scoured every inch 
of the shopping district,

668
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,870
and I found three different 
types of residuals.

669
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:54,370
Even Ijichi-san said we weren't likely 
to find any more than that.

670
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,660
Okay, got it. Thanks.

671
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,660
You bet!

672
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,170

673
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,200
My apologies.

674
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:39,510
Our inspection showed that someone 
lowered a second veil on top of my own.

675
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,710
In addition,

676
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,540
a semi-first-grade curse made 
an unexpected appearance.

677
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,900
It's my fault for not being more thorough.

678
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,890
I'll accept any punishment.

679
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,910
No, you're fine. You were just outclassed.

680
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,470
Meaning?

681
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,470
Do you have an idea who did it?

682
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,990
{\an8}Death to Fools
Punishment to the Weak
Love to the Strong

683
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,990
Geto Suguru.

684
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,990
One of the four special-grade jujutsu sorcerers,

685
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,500
who was banished from Jujutsu High

686
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,000
after cursing over a hundred 
normal people to death.

687
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,170
He's the worst curse user.

688
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,480
{\an8}Death to

689
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,480
{\an8}Punishment to

690
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,480
{\an8}Love to

691
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,320
Really, I'll be fine. Let's go home now.

692
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,860
It's all right. Just wait a little longer.

693
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:48,940
But...

694
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:09,890
So, you said your daughter 
was being haunted by a ghost.

695
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,850
Isn't that right, Sato-san?

696
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:16,930
Ah, yes... um... it's Saito, though...

697
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,430
No, you are Sato-san.

698
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,480
That's what I've decided, 
so Sato is better.

699
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,400
Uh-huh...

700
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,520
Mom, let's go home.

701
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,280
But you haven't been able 
to sleep lately, right?

702
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,990
This is so shady, though.

703
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,860
You constantly feel 
a piercing gaze upon you.

704
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,950
Sometimes your shoulders feel heavy, 
and it gets hard to breathe, doesn't it?

705
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,390
Almost as if you've forgotten how to breathe.

706
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,540
And you often

707
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,420
dream of being raped.

708
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,680
How did you know that?

709
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,140
Don't move.

710
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,530
Huh? No way... I feel much better!

711
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:16,530
Honestly, I don't know how 
we could ever repay you.

712
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,540
Oh, no, we should all help 
each other in times of need.

713
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,540
Please rely on me anytime you need to.

714
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:28,250
See, I told you he was simply godly!

715
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,040
Yeah.

716
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,430
Godly, huh?

717
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,760
You're a smart one, aren't you?

718
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,470
Filthy monkey who can't even use jujutsu.

719
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,980
Your true feelings are showing, Geto-sama.

720
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,350
The leaders have all gathered 
in the meeting room.

721
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,060
What are you doing?

722
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,030
It's disinfecting deodorant.

723
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,550
I don't want everyone to 
catch the monkey smell.

724
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,530
I'm so happy.

725
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,910
How long has it been since we all gathered?

726
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,660
I know. Let's take a photo together 
since we're all here.

727
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,660
Where'd I put my single-lens?

728
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,660
Right here.

729
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,340
Geto! Give me Geto!

730
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,420
Geto! Damn you!

731
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,130
Well, if it isn't Kanemori-san.

732
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,420
What brings you here in such a panic?

733
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,470
Don't play dumb!

734
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,430
Hurry up and exorcise my curse!

735
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,460
Do you know how much I've paid you?!

736
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,810
How much?

737
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,520
Roughly one hundred and five million yen.

738
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,440
But there have been no donations 
for the past six months.

739
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:31,780
Well—

740
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,690
Ah... I guess that's it for you.

741
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,440
What are you sayi—

742
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,200
All monkeys have their own role.

743
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,040
There are money-collecting monkeys

744
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,230
and curse-collecting monkeys.

745
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,840
You're the former.

746
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,800
If you're out of money, 
I have no further use for you.

747
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,920
Screw you!

748
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,430
Suck, suck... Suck, suck...

749
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:07,560
Suck, suck, suck, suck...

750
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,690
Disgusting.

751
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,820
Are they really the same species?

752
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,070
That's why I'm always saying

753
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,720
they're monkeys.

754
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,910
The time is right, my family.

755
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,660
Let's lower the curtain 
on the age of monkeys

756
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,950
and build a paradise for jujutsu sorcerers.

757
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:36,050
First, we must fell the
 cornerstone of the jujutsu world,

758
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,460
Jujutsu High.

759
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,510
What's the matter, Yuta?

760
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,880
Uh, well... I just had a bad premonition.

761
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:45,430
You're imagining things.

762
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,600
Yep, imagining things.

763
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,560
Bonito flakes.

764
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,510
Huh?

765
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,440
Guys, wait...

766
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,400
Well, your ability to sense 
cursed energy sucks, you know.

767
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,820
Figures it'd be dulled, with something 
like Rika constantly with you.

768
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,650
Tuna.

769
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,030
We still aren't picking up on 
any actions from Geto.

770
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,700
Are you sure you're not worried over nothing?

771
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,120
Principal, I'm sad to say that's not possible.

772
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,500
I confirmed it myself on the scene.

773
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,970
There's no way I would mistake 
the residuals of Suguru's cursed energy.

774
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:19,220
Suguru...

775
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,720
God damn it!

776
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,490
Speak of the devil!

777
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,010
Gather all sorcerers on campus, semi-first-grade 
and above, in the circle out front!

778
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,730
That's unusual.

779
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,770
Yuta's intuition was correct.

780
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,820
Salmon.

781
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,120
You're... not staff.

782
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,820
I haven't seen that curse before.

783
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,170
Salmon roe.

784
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,330
Wow, big bird!

785
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,290
This place never changes.

786
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:59,890
Yuck! Geto-sama, is this really Tokyo?

787
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,430
Feels like the sticks.

788
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,300
Nanako, that's rude.

789
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,140
What? But don't you think so, too, Mimiko?

790
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,470
Come on! Get off already!

791
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:09,900
Aren't you cold?

792
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,090
Who are they?

793
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,940
Whoa, it's a panda!

794
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,730
How cute!

795
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,310
And who are all of you?

796
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,810
Intruders aren't allowed in, by Yuta-san here.

797
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,660
Kelp!

798
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,570
Huh?

799
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,610
Go home before you get beaten!

800
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:23,530
By Yuta-san!

801
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,410
Huh?!

802
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,700
Nice to meet you, Okkotsu-kun.

803
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,040
I'm Geto Suguru.

804
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,790
He's fast!

805
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,670
Huh? Oh... Nice to meet you...

806
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,920
You possess a truly wonderful power, I see.

807
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,090
I believe that

808
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:44,880
great power ought to be used toward great ends.

809
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,210
Have you ever questioned 
the current state of the world?

810
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,060
This world where jujutsu 
sorcerers act in secret

811
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,400
in order to protect the order 
of commonplace society.

812
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,390
You see, there's this established paradox

813
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,180
saying the strong must accommodate the weak.

814
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,380
It's so deplorable!

815
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,900
Uh-huh...

816
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,830
The apex of all creation has 
halted its own path of evolution!

817
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,080
It's nonsense!

818
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,910
It's high time mankind reconsidered 
its strategy for survival!

819
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,080
Which is why we'd like you to help us.

820
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,380
Help with what?

821
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,050
We're going to kill all non-sorcerers

822
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,590
and create a world 
with only jujutsu sorcerers.

823
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,050
What...

824
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,730
...is he saying?

825
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:37,560
Could you stop preaching your 
crazy beliefs to my students?

826
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,070
Satoru! Long time no see!

827
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,320
First of all, get away from those kids, Suguru.

828
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:51,660
I had heard this year's first-years 
were all outstanding students.

829
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,830
Now I understand.

830
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,830
It was all your doing.

831
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,910
A special-grade cursed human,

832
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,040
a cursed corpse mutation,

833
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,800
the descendant of the cursed speech users,

834
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,380
and...

835
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:05,050
the Zen'in clan's failure.

836
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,590
You piece of...

837
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,590
Watch what you say.

838
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,850
Because I don't need any 
monkeys like you in my world.

839
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:17,770
I'm sorry.

840
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,500
I don't really understand 
what you're talking about,

841
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,560
but...

842
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,530
I can't help anyone who insults my friends!

843
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:34,410
My apologies. It wasn't 
my intention to upset you.

844
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,870
Then what exactly did you come for?

845
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,170
To declare war.

846
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,370
Everyone gathered here,

847
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,210
open your ears and listen closely!

848
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,760
On the coming December 24th, 
when the sun sets,

849
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,190
we shall conduct the Night 
Parade of a Hundred Demons.

850
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,310
It will take place in the crucible of curses,

851
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,730
Shinjuku, Tokyo...

852
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,730
Kabuki Town, First Street

853
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,980
and the holy land of jujutsu,

854
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,070
Kyoto.

855
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,200
We will unleash a thousand 
curses upon each place.

856
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,030
And of course, their command will be "massacre."

857
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,160
If you wish to avoid a scene straight out of hell,

858
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,160
come and stop it with all your might.

859
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,240
Let us freely

860
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,540
curse each other!

861
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,420
Geto-sama!

862
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,140
The store's gonna close!

863
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,890
It's already that late?

864
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,870
I'm sorry, Satoru.

865
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,220
These girls just insist on getting 
crêpes from Takeshita Street.

866
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,190
Hurry!

867
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,900
So I'll be taking my leave.

868
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,770
Good grief. I don't see what's so good 
about a place with so many monkeys.

869
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,980
Did you think we'd just let you leave?

870
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,990
You don't want to do that.

871
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,500
Your precious students are within my range.

872
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,580
Well, everyone, see you on the battlefield.

873
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,810
Survival of the weakest.

874
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,260
That's the proper form society should take.

875
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,160
It should help the weak 
and discourage the strong.

876
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,910
Listen, Satoru.

877
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:34,910
Sorcerers exist to protect non-sorcerers.

878
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:37,160
That's your argument?

879
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,670
I hate righteousness.

880
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,250
Are you the strongest 
because you're Gojo Satoru?

881
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,210
Or are you Gojo Satoru 
because you're the strongest?

882
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,010
What are you trying to say?

883
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,680
If I could become you,

884
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,360
then wouldn't my foolish ideals 
become reasonable possibilities?

885
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,850
I've decided how to live my life.

886
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:06,490
All that's left is to do what I can 
to the best of my ability.

887
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,100
Geto Suguru.

888
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,070
A special-grade curse user who 
uses cursed spirit manipulation.

889
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:56,110
He's able to draw in and manipulate 
naturally occurring, unbound curses.

890
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:02,580
It seems he's established a religious group 
to collect curses from its followers.

891
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:06,410
He should still have the curses 
he previously possessed,

892
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:11,570
and considering the declining trend in the 
number of curses reported in recent years...

893
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:16,090
His claim to possess 
2,000 may not be a bluff.

894
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:20,560
Even so, statistically, most of them 
have to be weaklings at grade 2 or below.

895
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,770
Even with a generous estimate, 
there can't be much more than 50 curse users.

896
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,100
That's actually the scary part.

897
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,360
I find it hard to believe he'd 
start a war he couldn't win.

898
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,280
God damn!

899
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,900
Put out a call for aid to all alumni, 
the three major clans, and even the Ainu Jujutsu Society.

900
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,410
It's all-out war!

901
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,910
This time, that curse, Geto, will be completely

902
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,410
exorcised!

903
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:50,170
That's what that muscle-brained principal 
is probably spouting right now.

904
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:56,170
December 24th, Day of the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons

905
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,390
If we seriously tried to kill each other,

906
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:06,810
our chance of success would be about 30%.

907
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,020
If the Jujutsu Society joins in as well,

908
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,320
we'll barely have a 20% chance.

909
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,180
However,

910
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,540
there's just one move that makes 
that slim chance of victory

911
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,410
jump straight to 99%.

912
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:32,420
I kill Okkotsu Yuta and obtain the special-grade 
cursed apparition, Orimoto Rika.

913
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:38,420
They still naïvely believe 
my bluff from my time in school.

914
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,510
It doesn't matter if 
the cursed spirit is bound.

915
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,640
So long as I kill its master,

916
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,430
I can absorb any curse I want.

917
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:50,190
With such high odds of victory,

918
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:53,270
the school won't use Okkotsu 
as one of their cards.

919
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:57,190
After all, there's a chance he could 
wipe out both enemies and allies.

920
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,070
The true purpose of the 
Night Parade of a Hundred Demons

921
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,740
is to get Okkotsu isolated and unprotected.

922
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,700
Now, let's raise the curtain on a new age.

923
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,250
It sounds like...

924
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,420
something crazy is going down.

925
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,050
Maki-san!

926
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,510
What are you doing here?

927
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:24,090
Classes are canceled for the week.

928
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:26,660
Well, I just felt kinda restless.

929
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,270
No one in the dorms is around, either.

930
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:33,940
That's because the second-years 
were dispatched to Kyoto earlier.

931
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,270
Toge and the third- and fourth-years 
are in Shinjuku as backup.

932
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,860
The principal really likes Panda, too,

933
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,660
so he's probably with Toge.

934
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,740
I see.

935
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,860
Ask.

936
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,790
Huh?

937
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,330
You've been curious, right?

938
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,500
About why I'm a "failure."

939
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, um... yes.

940
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,760
My family, the Zen'in clan,

941
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,190
is one of the elite families of jujutsu 
sorcerers known as the three major clans.

942
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:11,980
Do you know what the minimum requirement 
to be a jujutsu sorcerer is?

943
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,890
Huh? What is it?

944
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,140
It's being able to see curses.

945
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,390
Oh, right.

946
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,600
Ordinary people can sometimes see them 
in special circumstances, like at death's door,

947
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,900
but I can't see curses 
without these lame glasses.

948
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,620
The cursed tools I use are already 
imbued with cursed energy.

949
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,710
It doesn't come from me.

950
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,870
Though, thanks to that, 
I got out of that family.

951
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,040
The food was awful, the rooms were small,

952
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,390
and it was crawling with old men I didn't know.

953
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,510
It seriously sucked!

954
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,100
Don't use my last name.

955
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:54,810
Not everyone has a resistance 
to curses like you do!

956
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,140
Don't ask me about cursed energy.

957
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,190
Why are you still a jujutsu sorcerer, then?

958
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,570
Because I'm spiteful.

959
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,170
I'm going to make that family cry 
when I return to them

960
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,410
as a grade 1 sorcerer who can't see curses!

961
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,290
Then I'll crush the Zen'in clan from within!

962
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,590
What?

963
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:27,050
Oh, I was just thinking that's so like you.

964
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,040
I wish...

965
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,310
I could be like you.

966
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,160
I wish I could be so strong and unyielding.

967
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:46,650
I wish I had never given birth to you.

968
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,580
You're the shame of the Zen'in clan!

969
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,370
Everyone,

970
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:56,330
you don't want to turn out like Maki.

971
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,250
If there's ever anything 
I can help with, just ask.

972
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,760
Let's crush the Zen'in clan! Or something.

973
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,360
Moron. There's no point 
if I don't do it by myself.

974
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,900
I'm going back to my room.

975
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,400
Okay. Later.

976
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,020
Am I an idiot?

977
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,780
Don't start thinking this 
means you've been accepted!

978
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:35,140
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

979
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,240
Purify that which is impure.

980
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,130
A veil was drawn over the school?

981
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,760
But who... and why?

982
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,650
Keep the destruction of buildings 
and infrastructure to a minimum.

983
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,730
There's a chance some civilians 
still haven't evacuated.

984
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,830
If you find any, evacuate them.

985
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,020
Are you listening, Satoru?

986
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,160
There's one guy who looks like trouble.

987
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:15,280
I see. That bandaged guy.

988
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,700
Yes. We'll take on the rest.

989
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,250
I've said this many times, but...

990
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,540
I know.

991
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,790
We're only stalling them, right?

992
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,900
Let's just take it easy and have 
some fun until Geto finishes his job.

993
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,680
You're here?

994
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,390
Is it a problem if I am?

995
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:35,390
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

996
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:40,730
Sorry, but I don't have time 
to chat with monkeys.

997
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:42,350
Gojo-san!

998
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:43,770
I have a report!

999
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:46,980
What's the matter?

1000
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:47,810
Well...

1001
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,070
That guy loves to show off, 
and he's not on the front lines?

1002
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:53,820
Is he in Kyoto?

1003
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,310
We should have received 
some kind of word if he was.

1004
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,740
It's nothing. What's up?

1005
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:04,080
I know this isn't the best time, 
but I thought it wise to speak up sooner.

1006
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,520
It's about the investigation into Okkotsu-kun 
that you previously requested.

1007
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,180
Panda! Toge!

1008
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:15,180
What is—

1009
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,130
No questions!

1010
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,470
I'm sending you two to 
Jujutsu High right now!

1011
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:20,480
Huh?!

1012
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,020
Geto is there now.

1013
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,230
I'm absolutely, probably, certain!

1014
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,270
Which is it?!

1015
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,190
If my intuition is right,

1016
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,380
in the worst case, 
Yuta and Maki could both die!

1017
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:35,320
I'll head there right after 
I take care of that foreigner.

1018
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,700
Protect those two.

1019
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,660
Sorry, but defend them with your lives!

1020
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,870
Right!

1021
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,870
{\an8}Salmon!

1022
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,620
No way... They figured it out?

1023
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:51,300
This is why I said you should 
at least prepare a stand-in.

1024
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,550
A bad dummy would only make things worse.

1025
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,590
That's what Geto-sama said.

1026
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,050
Mimiko, Nanako!

1027
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,800
What?

1028
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,230
We're stepping up the plan. Engage.

1029
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,730
I've been waiting for this!

1030
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,740
I'm your opponent,

1031
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,150
special-grade.

1032
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,070
Sorry,

1033
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,860
but I'm in a hurry right now.

1034
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,450
A veil's been drawn!

1035
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,410
Does that mean Satoru's intuition was right?

1036
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,830
I'll break the veil!

1037
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:30,630
Then we'll take the shortest route!

1038
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,990
Pollack roe!

1039
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,540
Oh?

1040
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,880
Someone made a hole in the veil.

1041
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:42,180
Nothing ever goes quite as planned.

1042
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,680
Should take them five minutes 
from the point of entry to here.

1043
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,780
Should I ignore them, 
or should I take care of them?

1044
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:53,610
It's so hard to decide.

1045
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:02,200
They broke through all the walls 
to take the shortest route?

1046
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:04,200
Not bad.

1047
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:08,700
Maki!

1048
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,300
Focus.

1049
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,130
This guy can handle close combat, too?

1050
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:29,650
Oh?

1051
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:43,780
Predictable.

1052
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:46,030
Because it was a feint.

1053
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,170
Drumming Beat!

1054
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:10,860
That was close.

1055
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,360
Same to you.

1056
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,400
Plummet!

1057
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:26,660
Toge! You okay?

1058
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,370
Caviar.

1059
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,170
Yeah, Maki comes first.

1060
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,710
Maki, are you okay?

1061
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:36,710
Maki?

1062
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:37,880
Mustard leaf.

1063
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,590
N-Not yet...

1064
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,340
Huh?

1065
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:54,270
Another quake?

1066
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:56,770
I wonder what's going on.

1067
01:08:58,950 --> 01:08:59,910
Wonderful.

1068
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,990
Wonderful!

1069
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,530
I am incredibly touched right now!

1070
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:08,360
You all raced here to save Okkotsu, right?

1071
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:12,210
Jujutsu sorcerers are sacrificing 
themselves for a fellow sorcerer!

1072
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:14,710
Affection! Admiration!

1073
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,960
The world I long for

1074
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,370
is here before my eyes!

1075
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,090
Maki-san?

1076
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,730
To be honest,

1077
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:33,810
I wanted you to live, too, Okkotsu.

1078
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:37,380
But this is all for the 
future of the jujutsu world.

1079
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,820
Panda-kun...

1080
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,990
Yuta...

1081
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,990
Inumaki-kun...

1082
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,040
Run... away...

1083
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:55,410
Record: December 24th, 2017

1084
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,750
Come out, Rika!

1085
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:02,670
Special-Grade Cursed Apparition, Orimoto Rika

Fully Manifested a Second Time

1086
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,670
I will kill you.

1087
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:06,970
I'll murder you!

1088
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:22,690
Quantity before quality.

1089
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,690
What's your move, Queen of Curses?

1090
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:43,420
Rika.

1091
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,850
These three are horribly wounded, 
especially Maki-san.

1092
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:54,100
I won't let you die!

1093
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,360
Not fair, not fair!

1094
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,880
It's always you, always you!

1095
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,230
What are you doing, Rika?

1096
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:09,870
Huh?

1097
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:12,370
That woman saved me.

1098
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,150
Handle her with more care 
than a butterfly or a flower!

1099
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1100
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,840
Don't be mad.

1101
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,000
I'm not mad.

1102
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,210
Don't hate me.

1103
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,000
I don't hate you.

1104
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,010
Our enemy is that man there.

1105
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,760
Yuta, do you hate him?

1106
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,510
Yeah, I loathe him.

1107
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:41,480
Then I hate him, too!

1108
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,520
Welcome back.

1109
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,570
Why did you stop attacking?

1110
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:50,790
Healing with cursed energy requires 
an advanced reverse cursed technique.

1111
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:56,490
It was more advantageous to let you 
divide your attention over there.

1112
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,170
Now, shall we start where we left off?

1113
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,380
Rika, we're doing that.

1114
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,420
Snake Eyes and Fangs?

1115
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,340
Those are...

1116
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,850
The cursed seals of the Inumaki clan!

1117
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,400
Die.

1118
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,530
Wonderful!

1119
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:35,240
Cursed speech is a powerful technique 
passed down in the Inumaki clan,

1120
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,130
yet this young man pulled it off with 
less than a year of studying jujutsu!

1121
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,380
That really is hard to use.

1122
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:45,380
The cursed energy scatters, 
and it's hard to aim.

1123
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:47,630
Inumaki-kun is incredible.

1124
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:52,220
So Orimoto Rika's true form 
is ever-changing.

1125
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,640
She's an endless bundle of cursed energy.

1126
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,590
Yes.

1127
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:57,970
My friends are amazing.

1128
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,020
And you! You!

1129
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:04,270
I want her even more.

1130
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,020
I'll beat you to a pulp!

1131
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,350
Why is Nanami-san in Kyoto?

1132
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,980
I wanted him to see me shine!

1133
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,060
Shut up!

1134
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,890
Quit griping and fight!

1135
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:48,690
There are still more coming!

1136
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:53,320
Man, what a pain.

1137
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,090
That makes fifty.

1138
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,630
I've cleared the numbers 
required for the incentive,

1139
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:23,350
so now to work a little bit more 
and aim for that full bonus.

1140
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,570
How old are you two?

1141
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,650
Fifteen.

1142
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,490
You're still just children.

1143
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:35,840
It's not too late for you to turn back.

1144
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,320
You don't know right from wrong, do you?

1145
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:41,330
Annoying!

1146
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,790
Mimiko, doesn't he totally piss you off?

1147
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:45,830
Shall we hang him, Nanako?

1148
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,830
None of you know, do you?

1149
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:55,840
Just how jujutsu sorcerers are treated out 
in the damn sticks that aren't even on maps.

1150
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,010
Right or wrong?

1151
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:01,140
You all can enjoy that by yourselves.

1152
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,850
The way Geto-sama puts it,

1153
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:08,350
black is white, and white is black, too.

1154
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:16,190
We both believe in the world he's envisioned.

1155
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,440
Anyone who gets in his way...

1156
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,790
...we'll hang!

1157
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,450
Huh?!

1158
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:26,370
Miguel?

1159
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:27,830
What are you doing?!

1160
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:29,710
Look, and figure it out!

1161
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,340
You're tenacious.

1162
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,170
That rope...

1163
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:39,510
It has an unusual curse woven into it.

1164
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,540
It's disrupting my techniques.

1165
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:45,560
I barely have half left.

1166
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,580
How many decades do you think it took

1167
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:52,270
the sorcerers in my country 
to weave this one rope?!

1168
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:53,650
Like I care.

1169
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:55,770
One second of my time will outmatch it.

1170
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:57,400
That's all there is to it.

1171
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:57,400
{\an8}Dummy!

1172
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,480
You're in my way.

1173
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:08,310
Not good! Gojo-san's snapped!

1174
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:12,340
So this is the Limitless 
technique Geto mentioned.

1175
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,590
It interferes on the atomic level,

1176
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:19,340
controlling space-time with precise 
manipulation of cursed energy.

1177
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,300
And what makes that all possible 
is the power of those eyes.

1178
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,100
Just over twelve more 
minutes until my quota.

1179
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,300
I'll keep running for my life!

1180
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:03,890
Wow!

1181
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,270
Ouch!

1182
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,290
That last round was dangerous.

1183
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:40,300
I'll focus on hit-and-run.

1184
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,510
I'll give everything I've got 
to endure these last ten minutes.

1185
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:46,300
If I die, I'm cursing you, Geto!

1186
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,940
Ieri-san, please look at this one, too.

1187
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:55,100
I will. Set him down over there.

1188
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:55,890
Right!

1189
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:58,140
What were you all doing?

1190
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,530
It's all right.

1191
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,800
Ieri-san will fix you up.

1192
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,450
We're counting on you!

1193
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,900
Sheesh.

1194
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,410
You really forced a heap 
of trouble on us, Geto.

1195
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,890
It's your first time experiencing 
such violent emotion,

1196
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,340
and cursed energy is 
filling your body, isn't it?

1197
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:23,310
That heightening of physical prowess, 
that sense of omnipotence...

1198
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:25,670
Your senses must be sharpened, too.

1199
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,260
The riff-raff are no match for you now.

1200
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,140
I'll have to crush you myself.

1201
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,890
Follow my lead, Rika.

1202
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:38,390
Mankind stands at the top of the food chain,

1203
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:42,900
yet they imagined the existence 
of higher beings and called them gods.

1204
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:45,400
Don't you find that strange?

1205
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,790
Especially when we jujutsu 
sorcerers exist without belief.

1206
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,410
In the end, those monkeys

1207
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:47,300
just want to avert their eyes from the 
existence of those better than them.

1208
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:51,680
Don't go saying childish crap 
like you want to be a god!

1209
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:53,760
You're missing the point,

1210
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,220
Okkotsu.

1211
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,920
What I long for isn't enlightenment. 
It's a chosen people.

1212
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:20,960
There are times when the strong are buried and 
oppressed by the weak due to sheer numbers.

1213
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,500
And I'm telling you that the audacity
of the monkeys who do that

1214
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,630
makes me so sick I could vomit.

1215
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,600
Yuta, Yuta...

1216
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:33,600
It's all right. I'm used to it now.

1217
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,720
Are we done debating?

1218
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,270
He's even faster!

1219
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,880
You shouldn't have done that.

1220
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,630
When you imbue a curse like that 
too abruptly, the vessel won't last.

1221
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,040
Didn't Satoru teach you that?

1222
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,710
You imbue curses bit by—

1223
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:21,440
You're not bad.

1224
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:23,560
I don't understand!

1225
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:27,060
I don't know about any 
sorcerers outside of this school,

1226
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,570
so I don't know

1227
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,320
if you're right or not!

1228
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:36,030
But in order to remain with all my friends...

1229
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:40,830
In order for me to believe 
it's okay that I'm alive...

1230
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,540
I have to kill you!

1231
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:48,170
You're egotistical.

1232
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,880
Still, self-affirmation, huh?

1233
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,550
There's probably nothing more 
important than that in life.

1234
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:59,720
In which case, I'll also use 
my full force to kill you.

1235
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:02,430
I won't compromise on quality 
or quantity anymore.

1236
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,600
Did you know

1237
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,270
there are only four people 
crowned special-grade?

1238
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,950
Among curses, there are sixteen.

1239
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,780
This is one of them.

1240
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:15,400
Special-grade potential apparition,

1241
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:18,780
Tamamo-no-mae incarnate!

1242
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,080
On top of that,

1243
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:25,290
I'll combine the 4,461 
curses I possess into one,

1244
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,290
and strike you with it.

1245
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:32,630
Cursed Spirit Manipulation, Supreme Art:

1246
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,520
Maelstrom.

1247
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:10,960
Nanami-san.

1248
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,590
I'll take care of it.

1249
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,860
New Shadow Style, Simple Domain!

1250
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,820
Quick Draw!

1251
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,330
Don't let your guard down, Miwa!

1252
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:22,660
Mechamaru, above!

1253
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,910
You, too.

1254
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,940
Everyone, stay alert.

1255
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,420
Kamo-kun.

1256
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:37,000
Seven cursed spirits at two o'clock.

1257
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,380
Roger that. Where did Todo go?

1258
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,390
Oh, I think you'll see him soon.

1259
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,690
Where have you been all this time, Todo—

1260
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:59,190
Wh-What is that cursed energy?

1261
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,910
That one's dangerous, Todo!

1262
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:04,120
Don't rush in on your own!

1263
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,160
Wait for back—

1264
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,490
Starting at eight, the talk show's

1265
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,950
Christmas live special will be

1266
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:11,170
hosting Takada-chan!

1267
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:15,830
I can't keep wasting any time here!

1268
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:16,630
Todo!

1269
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:17,920
Kamo-kun.

1270
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:21,930
Another ten or more cursed spirits 
are approaching from six o'clock.

1271
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:24,800
Everyone, prepare to intercept them!

1272
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,340
Jeez, there's no end to them.

1273
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,150
When is this going to be over?

1274
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:35,060
Okkotsu.

1275
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:42,780
I'm truly glad I came to kill you 
before you could fully wield Orimoto Rika.

1276
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,500
It's a promise.

1277
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,460
When we both grow up, we'll get married.

1278
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:56,670
Sure.

1279
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:03,010
Then we'll be together forever and ever!

1280
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,060
Rika.

1281
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,440
Yes?

1282
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,890
Thank you for always protecting me.

1283
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,940
Thank you for falling in love with me.

1284
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:22,240
Could you lend me your power one last time?

1285
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,900
I want to stop him.

1286
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:29,580
I don't need anything else after that.

1287
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:35,910
I'll give you my future, 
my heart, my body, everything.

1288
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,590
From now on, we'll truly be together forever.

1289
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:46,220
I love you, Rika.

1290
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,160
Shall we die together?

1291
01:26:57,730 --> 01:27:00,740
Yuta! Yuta!

1292
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:04,240
I love, love, love you!

1293
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:08,600
He's offering himself as a sacrifice to 
release the limit on her cursed energy?!

1294
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,250
So that's how you want it, womanizer?!

1295
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,330
That's rude.

1296
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,710
It's pure love.

1297
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:21,510
Then I fight for justice!

1298
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,720
Wonderful!

1299
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,010
Absolutely wonderful!

1300
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:17,100
Truly the power to change the world!

1301
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:22,610
If I had Rika, there would be no need 
to sneak around gathering curses.

1302
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,430
Next time.

1303
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:27,390
Next time, I'll obtain her!

1304
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:34,970
You're late,

1305
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:36,960
Satoru.

1306
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:40,460
To think you'd be the one here at my end.

1307
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,630
Is my family safe?

1308
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,540
Every last one of them managed to escape.

1309
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:49,640
The ones in Kyoto were 
under your orders, too, right?

1310
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:51,760
Yeah.

1311
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:55,640
Unlike you, I'm a kind man.

1312
01:28:56,140 --> 01:29:00,400
You sent those two assuming 
that I'd defeat them, didn't you?

1313
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,650
To set Okkotsu off.

1314
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:04,940
I trusted you.

1315
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:10,450
Trusted that a man as principled as you wouldn't 
kill off young sorcerers without a reason.

1316
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,240
Trust, huh?

1317
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:22,540
I didn't think I still had any of that left.

1318
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,250
Return this for me, will you?

1319
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:32,300
Was the elementary school your doing, too?

1320
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,610
Yeah.

1321
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,800
I can't believe you.

1322
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:40,060
Do you have any last words?

1323
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:43,160
No matter what anyone says,

1324
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:46,060
I hate those monkeys.

1325
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,070
But I never held any hatred 
for those in Jujutsu High.

1326
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:58,030
I just couldn't wear a 
heartfelt smile in this world.

1327
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:01,600
Suguru.

1328
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,100
At least hit me with some curses at my end.

1329
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,880
Hey! Hey!

1330
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,910
Yuta! Yuta!

1331
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:46,910
Hey!

1332
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,880
Hey, Yuta! Are you okay?!

1333
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,760
Mustard leaf.

1334
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,630
Wake up, Yuta!

1335
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:57,090
Oh, he's awake.

1336
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,020
Everyone...

1337
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,020
Your injuries...

1338
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,180
Maki-san. Inumaki-kun.

1339
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,770
Wait! Panda-kun, your arm isn't healed!

1340
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:09,900
Chill out. We're all doing better 
than you right now.

1341
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:14,150
Unlike these other two, 
my arm can be fixed later.

1342
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,650
Thanks for saving us.

1343
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,150
Salmon.

1344
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,160
Yuta...

1345
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,670
Sorry, Rika-chan.

1346
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:32,460
I've kept you waiting.

1347
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,810
What's the matter, Yuta?

1348
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,510
Well, uh...

1349
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,850
In exchange for borrowing her power,

1350
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:43,680
um, I promised to go with Rika-chan.

1351
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,430
What?!

1352
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:47,020
Don't you know that means dying?!

1353
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,640
What were you thinking, you idiot?!

1354
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,710
Uh, well, I...

1355
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:54,690
Huh?

1356
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:56,460
Rika-chan?

1357
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,950
Congratulations.

1358
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,950
You managed to break the curse.

1359
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,040
Who are you?

1360
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,290
Your good-looking guy, Gojo Satoru-sensei!

1361
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,840
I thought the theory Yuta came 
up with sounded interesting,

1362
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,710
so I requested an investigation 
into their families.

1363
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:18,000
The investigation of Rika's was 
finished quite a long time ago,

1364
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,890
but Yuta's was full of holes at best.

1365
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:23,350
So then it came to light.

1366
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:27,140
You're the descendant of Sugawara Michizane!

1367
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:29,470
That makes us super distant relatives!

1368
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:30,270
Suga?!

1369
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:34,480
{\an8}Yay! Yay! Yay! Yuta, yay!

1370
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:31,610
Huh? Who?

1371
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:33,690
One of Japan's three great apparitions!

1372
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:35,570
He's a super bigshot sorcerer.

1373
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:36,400
Tuna.

1374
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,400
You were right, Yuta.

1375
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:41,240
Rika didn't place a curse on you.

1376
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:44,890
You placed a curse on Rika.

1377
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:49,510
Rika-chan...

1378
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,290
What do I do?! Is she going to die?! 
I have to save her!

1379
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:56,590
Don't die! Don't die! 
Don't die! Don't die! Don't die!

1380
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,010
That's right.

1381
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:04,510
Back then, I rejected Rika-chan's death.

1382
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,750
Now the one who placed 
the curse has canceled the bond.

1383
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:13,900
So long as the one who was cursed 
doesn't seek any penalty,

1384
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,440
it's fully broken now.

1385
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:19,400
Of course, that much was obvious 
after seeing her in that form.

1386
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:24,450
It was all my fault, wasn't it?

1387
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:27,700
I turned you into that form,

1388
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:30,330
I hurt all those people,

1389
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:34,290
and I nearly caused everyone to die 
when Geto came after me!

1390
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,750
It's all...

1391
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:38,890
It's all my...

1392
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:44,590
Yuta, thank you...

1393
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:46,930
for giving me more time,

1394
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:49,340
and letting me stay by your side.

1395
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,810
These past six years,

1396
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:54,310
I've been happier than I ever was while alive.

1397
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:10,370
Bye-bye. Take care.

1398
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:15,750
And don't come over here too soon, okay?

1399
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,750
Okay.

1400
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,070
See you later.

1401
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:57,210
It's a bit late now,

1402
01:34:57,610 --> 01:35:00,220
but you weren't at fault 
for the incident with Geto.

1403
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:03,800
He would've come to Jujutsu High 
whether you were there or not.

1404
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,220
You think so?

1405
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:06,760
Also, here.

1406
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,300
Oh, my student ID.

1407
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,100
You found it for me, Sensei?

1408
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,600
No, not me.

1409
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,600
My best friend.

1410
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,610
The only one I had.

1411
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:24,610
Come on, Yuta! How long are 
you gonna keep us waiting?

1412
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,610
Let's go!

1413
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:34,200
Yeah.

1414
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:44,630
Theatrical Release

1415
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:44,630
JUJUTSU KAISEN

1416
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:44,630
JUJUTSU KAISEN

1417
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:44,630
JUJUTSU KAISEN

1418
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,920
This is good.

1419
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,670
Isn't it?

1420
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:08,460
I used a spice called Royco.

1421
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:11,520
That gives it a good flavor.

1422
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:18,430
Royco is a magic powder that makes 
everything taste Kenyan when you add it.

1423
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:21,530
More importantly, 
they really went home, right?

1424
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:23,440
Yeah.

1425
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:25,530
Good, then.

1426
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:29,150
This really is good. It's like nikujaga.

1427
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:30,200
Nikujaga?

1428
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,080
Call it beef stew. Beef stew!

1429
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:38,200
What's wrong?

1430
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:41,710
What are you doing here?

1431
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:43,710
Huh?

1432
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,880
Sensei?

1433
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,710
Hey. Long time no see.
