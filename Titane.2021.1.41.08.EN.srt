Stop it.

12
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:00,358
Stop it!

13
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:08,858
Put on your fucking seatbelt!

14
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,565
Can you move your hands for me?

15
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:40,778
Now lift your arms.

16
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:51,492
Watch out for any neurological signs.

17
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:54,276
Motor function, coordination, diction.

18
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:55,775
As you know.

19
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,499
Could the plate move in her head?

20
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,088
No.

21
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,900
Not without violent impact.

22
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,519
It's very solid.

23
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,563
It's titanium.

24
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:11,316
Get off me, asshole!

25
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,775
Hands off, sir.
Touch with your eyes.

26
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,364
Can I get a selfie?

27
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,542
I'm Justine.

28
00:08:58,465 --> 00:08:59,364
Ah!

29
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:00,754
Wait! Don't move.

30
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:02,792
Hang on, I got it.

31
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,341
So what's your name?

32
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,498
Do you beep at security?

33
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,547
No. Imagine having to
flash cops before every flight.

34
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,269
Does it hurt?

35
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,723
Not at all.

36
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:33,512
- We're waiting!
- Can't you see we're busy?

37
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:38,262
- You said it didn't hurt.
- Yanking always hurts!

38
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,425
Alexia, an autograph please.

39
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,207
Thanks.

40
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,384
I'm done.

41
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:32,945
Alexia!

42
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:38,029
Alexia!

43
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,121
Alexia, please.
Just an autograph.

44
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,685
Sorry, but I waited three hours...

45
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,720
We met at the boat show in Marseille.
Remember?

46
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,764
No, sorry. Good night.

47
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:58,274
Wait!

48
00:10:58,738 --> 00:10:59,987
Can I get a kiss goodbye?

49
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,292
Sorry, I just wanted to say...

50
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:12,394
I think I'm in love with you.

51
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:17,131
You probably think I'm crazy.

52
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:19,059
I doubt you feel the same.

53
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,316
But maybe we could be friends,

54
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,618
and then see?

55
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:28,015
What do you think?

56
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,965
<i>The Adrien Legrand case is

00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:56,565
<i>The mystery remains.</i>

68

78
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,026
- You OK?
- My belly hurts.

79
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,889
- Your period?
- I'm not always on the rag.

80
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:41,024
Whatever.
Ask your dad to examine you.

81
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,770
- It's nothing.
- Wait, here.

82
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,665
First time with a girl?

83
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:54,756
You can move down, you know.

84
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:18,346
What the fuck?

85
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:21,852
Stop, it hurts!

86
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:34,827
Whatever.

87
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,609
Coming?

88
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:46,322
Are you kidding me?

89
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:48,416
Fuck!

90
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:41,567
What's wrong?

91
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:42,986
What's wrong?

92
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:15,981
So what is it?

93
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,725
Crazy you didn't feel it sooner.

94
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,146
Ah!

95
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,399
What do you think you're doing?

96
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:16,442
Romain? What's going on?

97
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,417
Call the cops! Now!

98
00:27:14,823 --> 00:27:16,496
Sorry, is the bathroom occupied?

99
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:25,645
How many of you are there?

100
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:27,336
What do you mean?

101
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,992
There's Cri-Cri, Romu,

102
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,591
Juju and me.

103
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:34,763
Are more coming?

104
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:36,110
Hope not.

105
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,249
I'm Alex.

106
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:43,726
Jérôme. Or Jupi, to my friends.

107
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,896
Who'd you come with?

108
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,885
Are you OK?

109
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,231
I'm so wiped.

110
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,239
I can lend you my bed.

111
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,891
Hey, last stop.
I'm not going any farther.

112
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:41,797
Maybe just a little farther?

There's no mother.

I don't know where she is.

126
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:11,998
You don't have to say anything.

127
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:15,068
Just nod or shake your head if you like.

128
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:26,691
- We'll do a DNA test.
- What for?

129
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,759
Think I can't recognize my own son?

Accident on Route 389.

131

Death on scene...

00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,217
You haven't said a word.

133

Can't you say something?

134
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,322
Never mind.
You'll talk when you're ready.

135
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:06,257
Anyone hurts you, I kill 'em.

136
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:08,085
Got it?

137
00:40:10,736 --> 00:40:11,915
Even if it's me.

138
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:13,908
I'd kill myself, I swear.

139
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:27,625
Captain!

140
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,479
I saved you some dinner.

141
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,711

00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,352
Adrien, meet Rayane.

146
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:54,266
Conscience.

147
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,083
Everyone calls me that.

148
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:02,608
Go get some sleep, it's late.

149
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:05,544
- It's okay, I'm not on duty.
- Right.

150
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,426
But we're tired.

151
00:41:08,797 --> 00:41:10,870
Of course. I know.

152
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,243
So, good night.

153
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,139
You too, Adrien.

154
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:23,792
Captain?

155
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,396
I'm happy for you.

156
00:43:04,571 --> 00:43:06,042
Just came to say good night.

157
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:12,230
Sleeping in your clothes?

158
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:17,466
Here.

159
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:22,896
Whoa!

160
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:29,382
Give me your clothes.

161
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:32,247
Give them to me or I'll undress you.

162
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:08,052
Done yet?

163
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:45,705
Fucking hell!

164
00:45:54,995 --> 00:45:56,412
C'mon!

165
00:46:03,878 --> 00:46:05,231
God damn it!

166
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:06,716
Fuck this!

167
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,603
Stay put.

168
00:47:46,703 --> 00:47:47,752
Turn around.

169
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,675
Show me.

170
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:31,289
There.

171
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:33,866
You're starting to look decent.

172
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,882
Hey.

173
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,618
Who's that?

174
00:48:49,379 --> 00:48:50,428
You'll see.

175
00:48:57,339 --> 00:48:59,010
Guys, the Captain's checking on us.

176
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:08,987
Is he some retard
who wants to live the dream?

177
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,518
For real? No, he's normal.

178
00:49:11,904 --> 00:49:14,161
You know, like for some TV special?

179
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,580
- Know what I mean?
- Sure.

180
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:18,993
But what the fuck?

181
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:21,002
- Seriously.
- He's normal!

182
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:22,346
No, he's weird.

183
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:27,022
- Got a problem?
- No, Captain, just getting acquainted.

184
00:49:27,254 --> 00:49:28,878
We'll take him to see the trucks.

185
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:32,252
A little advice, take it or leave it.

186
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:35,795
Fireman Legrand is my son.

187
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:38,180
And who am I to you?

188
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:39,980
I'm God.

189
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:42,314
So he's not only your brother,

190
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:43,647
he's Jesus.

191
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:45,976
Jesus will speak
when he has something to say.

192
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:47,629
And we'll listen. Got it?

193
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:52,017
Hey! Got it?

194
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:53,443
Yes, Captain.

195
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:55,979
That's better.

196
00:50:01,856 --> 00:50:03,928
Turns out Jesus is white and gay!

197
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,031
Captain says believe, you believe.

198
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:13,196
C'mon, stop brown-nosing.

199
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:20,514
Rayane! Get down!

200
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,270
Four minutes on the stopwatch, Captain.

201
00:50:37,828 --> 00:50:39,528
Take the kitchen.
I got the bedroom.

202
00:50:39,858 --> 00:50:40,942
Copy.

203
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,802
Something wrong, Captain?

204
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:22,798
Control!

205
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:25,006
I don't get it.
All looks normal.

206
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:27,231
<i>Okay, end simulation.</i>

207
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:44,875
Will you ever speak?

208
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:51,266
Huh?

209
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:54,292
Huh?

210
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:57,065
Just say "yes" like a normal person!

211
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:58,776
Even parrots can say yes!

212
00:52:00,806 --> 00:52:02,139
No need to be human.

213
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,422
Even my phone says yes. Look.

214
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:08,545
- Say yes.
- <i>Yes.</i>

215
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,605
See? 20 euros for that shit.

216
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:24,906
What's that?

217
00:52:29,195 --> 00:52:30,244
Show me.

218
00:52:35,662 --> 00:52:36,828
Do I scare you?

219
00:52:39,828 --> 00:52:40,980
I won't hurt you.

220
00:52:41,906 --> 00:52:43,158
I just want to see.

221
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:45,069
Show me.

222
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:46,148
Hang on!

223
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:49,130
Stay, please. You'll see. Stay.

224
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:40,428
What's that?

225
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,363
What's that for?

226
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:46,939
You in a knitting club?

227
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,934
Wanna fight? Yeah?

228
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,567
Go on, fight like a man.

229
00:54:50,618 --> 00:54:51,909
Fight like a man!

230
00:54:55,716 --> 00:54:56,765
Go on.

231
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:07,606
Why do you always want to leave?

232
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:11,345
You're already home.

233
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,609
Here.

234
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:43,105
I brought back two or three hoes.
Biggest asses you ever saw!

235
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:44,821
Bitches be twerking, like...

236
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:53,313
Just give me a hole.
Black, Arab, whatever!

237
00:57:53,397 --> 00:57:54,938
A hole is a hole!

238
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:56,904
I don't care, bring it on.

239
00:57:56,954 --> 00:57:58,220
Hey, girl!

240
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:01,063
I'm talking to you! You hear me?

241
00:58:01,146 --> 00:58:02,225
Girl!

242
00:58:02,276 --> 00:58:05,563
Chill. Just wanna talk to you.

243
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:07,176
We won't hurt you.

244
00:58:07,227 --> 00:58:09,415
Forget talking. Be direct, bruh.

245
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:12,633
I'd turn her around
and shove it in her ass.

246
00:58:14,168 --> 00:58:16,146
Pussy, mouth, wherever she wants.

247
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,979
Even in her ear, bruh.

248
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:19,313
Hey, slut!

249
00:58:19,364 --> 00:58:22,938
We say two words and
they think we wanna gang bang.

250
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:25,313
We're talking to you!
Turn around!

251
00:58:25,397 --> 00:58:27,134
She thinks she's a star.

252
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:29,855
Go see her, grow some balls!

253
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:32,492
Go see her! Go on!

254
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:24,352
Dad?

255
01:00:26,094 --> 01:00:27,246
Wake up, Dad.

256
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:32,360
Dad.

257
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:57,026
Adrien?

258
01:02:00,712 --> 01:02:01,761
Adrien?

259
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:07,918
Adrien, are you up?

260
01:02:25,896 --> 01:02:28,034
What... what are you doing?

261
01:02:32,021 --> 01:02:33,892
Come. Come.

262
01:02:38,176 --> 01:02:39,282
Sit down.

263
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:04,474
They can't tell me you're not my son.

264
01:03:39,533 --> 01:03:43,189
He usually takes a sleeping pill, but...

265
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:46,513
he always wakes up in the morning, so...

266
01:03:46,938 --> 01:03:49,229
I waited until 10, but...

267
01:03:49,728 --> 01:03:51,027
at this point...

268
01:03:51,652 --> 01:03:52,998
I don't know.

269
01:03:53,565 --> 01:03:56,629
He must've taken one too many by accident.

270
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:58,157
Anyway...

271
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:00,667
I hope I didn't bother you for nothing.

272
01:04:00,718 --> 01:04:02,705
I mean, I hope I did!

273
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:04,727
You know what I mean.

274
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,480
Did you go see?

275
01:04:06,562 --> 01:04:09,813
No! I never go in his room.

276
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:13,249
He could be with a girlfriend.
I leave him alone.

277
01:04:13,575 --> 01:04:15,167
How old is your son?

278
01:04:15,443 --> 01:04:16,492
Forty-five.

279
01:04:17,662 --> 01:04:19,814
Don't speak or touch anything.
Just watch.

280
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:22,522
Your usual.

281
01:04:22,644 --> 01:04:25,146
Open up, honey. I'm with...

282
01:04:25,536 --> 01:04:26,687
Allow me, ma'am.

283
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,254
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

284
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:34,379
Stay. You were upgraded.

285
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:35,880
So enjoy the show.

286
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:39,289
Rayane, we need to intubate, now.

287
01:04:42,221 --> 01:04:44,729
What's wrong?
He's not breathing?

288
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:46,044
Adrien, help us!

289
01:04:57,412 --> 01:04:59,450
Do you think he did it on purpose?

290
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,021
He didn't mean to...

291
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:04,839
Help me.

292
01:05:26,437 --> 01:05:27,981
Fuck, now she's croaking!

293
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:32,546
Get backup.
Adrien, check her breathing.

294
01:05:32,626 --> 01:05:33,536
That's my role.

295
01:05:33,587 --> 01:05:35,344
Move it! Move!

296
01:05:39,388 --> 01:05:41,762
Press her thorax 30 times.

297
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:45,155
Then plug her nose
and blow into her mouth.

298
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:46,255
Then start over.

299
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,453
Look at me. Know the Macarena?

300
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:55,291
We'll sing it together.

301
01:05:55,857 --> 01:05:57,012
Follow me.

302
01:05:57,063 --> 01:05:58,581
Press as hard as you can.

303
01:05:59,452 --> 01:06:01,925

- He got her. Rayane, take over.
- Move.

319
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:42,592
Ma'am?

320
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:45,766
Wake up, ma'am!

321
01:06:47,776 --> 01:06:48,825
Madam?

322
01:07:16,188 --> 01:07:17,237
Go.

323
01:08:12,991 --> 01:08:14,490
Where you from, for real?

324
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:50,809
I'm listening.

325
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:53,242
It's about your son.

326
01:10:53,904 --> 01:10:55,327
We don't talk about my son.

327
01:10:57,776 --> 01:10:59,855
- It's important.
- Don't talk about my son.

328
01:10:59,906 --> 01:11:00,955
Ever.

329
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,275
Crawl back into the hole you came from!

330
01:11:18,515 --> 01:11:19,660
You hear me?

331
01:11:20,394 --> 01:11:22,013
Can't you feel the energy?

332
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:23,891
Between you and me?

333
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:02,834
Mom's here.

334
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:13,794
Not gonna kiss him?

335
01:13:57,536 --> 01:13:58,585
How are you doing?

336
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:02,065
Are you adapting?

337
01:14:04,204 --> 01:14:06,068
- Not too lost here?
- He doesn't talk.

338
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,085
I looked it up, it's normal.

339
01:14:10,453 --> 01:14:12,256
Am I allowed to talk to him?

340
01:14:12,876 --> 01:14:14,007
Sure, go ahead.

341
01:14:14,312 --> 01:14:15,550
But he's fine here.

342
01:14:16,396 --> 01:14:17,495
Go ahead.

343
01:14:18,677 --> 01:14:20,260
We could go somewhere.

344
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:22,717
Just us two.

345
01:14:36,577 --> 01:14:37,829
How do you do it?

346
01:14:40,938 --> 01:14:43,270
Living here, next to his empty room.

347
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,083
His toys, his clothes...

348
01:14:45,557 --> 01:14:46,606
Must be hell.

349
01:14:48,932 --> 01:14:51,030
His smell still permeates the walls.

350
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:54,934
Why inflict that on yourself?

351
01:15:01,207 --> 01:15:02,819
Give us a minute, please, honey.

352
01:15:17,841 --> 01:15:19,172
I won't let you take him.

353
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,356
I don't want him, Vincent.

354
01:15:50,494 --> 01:15:51,997
Ah.

355
01:16:22,721 --> 01:16:23,866
Stop!

356
01:16:32,996 --> 01:16:34,595
Please, please...

357
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:36,595
Stop, stop...

358
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:39,562
Please, stop.

359
01:18:05,965 --> 01:18:07,277
If you were me?

360
01:18:09,543 --> 01:18:12,207
If you couldn't mourn your kid,
what would you do?

361
01:18:14,442 --> 01:18:15,491
Huh?

362
01:18:35,809 --> 01:18:37,018
You poor thing.

363
01:18:38,312 --> 01:18:41,854
You poor, poor thing.
What mess did you get yourself in?

364
01:18:44,838 --> 01:18:49,666
Whatever your twisted reasons
for exploiting his fucking folly,

365
01:18:49,973 --> 01:18:52,151
I don't care, just take care of him.

366
01:18:52,922 --> 01:18:54,082
Look at me.

367
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:57,982
You take care of him.

368
01:19:00,592 --> 01:19:02,842
He needs someone, you or another.

369
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:05,603
Say it.

370
01:19:18,317 --> 01:19:22,812
<i>Still no trace of the young woman
suspected in the series of murders</i>

371
01:19:22,895 --> 01:19:25,604
<i>that has shaken the South this year.</i>

372
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:27,774
<i>The 32-year-old dancer...</i>

373
01:19:31,106 --> 01:19:32,697
Adrien, can you come?

374
01:19:40,184 --> 01:19:41,389
Help me, please.

375
01:19:42,008 --> 01:19:43,114
Wait!

376
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:44,760
Come help me, please.

377
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,473
Here.

378
01:19:53,579 --> 01:19:54,943
I'm sick of twisting.

379
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:57,020
Shoot straight into the muscle.

380
01:19:57,594 --> 01:19:58,825
Then press down.

381
01:19:59,437 --> 01:20:01,348
Avoid bruises, if you pity your dad.

382
01:20:02,408 --> 01:20:03,553
Are you sick?

383
01:20:06,073 --> 01:20:07,122
No.

384
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,674
I'm old.

385
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:41,448
Stop!

386
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,215
Sorry.

387
01:21:26,157 --> 01:21:28,435
I take care of you.
Not the other way round.

388
01:21:30,246 --> 01:21:31,378
Sit down.

389
01:21:39,385 --> 01:21:40,561
Do you trust me?

390
01:21:52,329 --> 01:21:53,614
We'll make it grow.

391
01:22:53,405 --> 01:22:54,453
Get down!

392
01:23:03,009 --> 01:23:04,644
Ah!

393
01:23:05,688 --> 01:23:07,229
- You okay?
- Yeah.

394
01:23:07,327 --> 01:23:08,992
- Dizzy?
- No.

395
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,104
- Blurry vision?
- No!

396
01:23:11,242 --> 01:23:13,739
- What's my name?
- Get me up!

397
01:23:14,754 --> 01:23:15,940
No.

398
01:23:16,337 --> 01:23:17,386
What's my name?

399
01:23:22,196 --> 01:23:23,529
And her? Know her name?

400
01:23:55,727 --> 01:23:57,465
They need you in back, Captain.

401
01:23:58,052 --> 01:23:59,510
We secure and retreat?

402
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:06,461
Only one? Is it secured?

403
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:11,040
Captain!
Should we secure it first?

404
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:17,840
Hold this.

405
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:36,364
I'm sorry.

406
01:27:06,876 --> 01:27:07,925
Are you okay?

407
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:20,603
I don't care who you are.

408
01:27:23,066 --> 01:27:24,149
You're my son.

409
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:26,689
You'll always be my son.

410
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:28,683
Whoever you are.

411
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:31,475
Is that clear?

412
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,228

Push.

Look at me. Look at me!
