00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,750
And if you're not ready,
maybe I should break up with you.

180
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,250
-You better not listen to her.
-Hmm.

181
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,750
She's just jealous.

182
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,541
-Jealous of what?
-Uh.

183
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,583
She sees that you're
in a steady relationship

184
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,875
and she can't take it.

185
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,666
She has never liked me
from the very start.

186
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,333
Somebody that can't keep a man,
that's who gives you advice?

187
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,375
All right.

188
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,958
What about your uncle?

189
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,583
The one that sends you on errands,

190
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,916
then gives you little
or no money afterward.

191
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,833
But when he wants to
go to England and America,

192
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,375
he will get on a first class plane.

193
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,750
When he wants to travel
within Nigeria, he will call you,

194
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,333
"Sanwo, let's go."

195
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,458
Why is that? Why?

196
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,583
Go and ask him.

197
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,750
-I should go and ask him?
-Mm.

198
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,083
Is that someone that wishes you well?

199
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:29,583
Look, Tolani.
Leave my uncle out of this. You hear?

200
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,291
-I'm sure it's because of his wife.
-Mm.

201
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,916
Sure, she's to blame. That's true.

202
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,166
-She's the one.
-Mm.

203
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,625
I'm not even here to discuss that either.

204
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,291
The discussion is two ways now, hmm?

205
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,083
You've said your speech,
let me say my own.

206
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,166
Talk.

207
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,333
I'm listening.

208
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,708
Tolani.

209
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,666
I know you're getting frustrated.

210
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,250
-I'm working on a new deal.
-Ha.

211
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,291
-This one is different.
-I said I don't want to hear it. Ah.

212
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,791
That's fine then.

213
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,291
Are you upset?

214
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,791
All right, what deal?

215
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,416
-All you have to know is it's risk-free.
-Mm..

216
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,458
Tolani, I won't disappoint you.
I'm not a bastard.

217
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,875
-I'd like to believe so.
-I'm just playing with you.

218
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,708
-Come here.
-Leave me alone.

219
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,000
[horns honking]

220
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,458
-My sister.
-Uncle.

221
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,041
Have you heard?

222
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,625
-Salako sacked Rose.
-What! Why?

223
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,958
She slapped him.

224
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:08,958
Hey!

225
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,208
It was from Franca I heard it.

226
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,041
-When?
-Thirty minutes ago.

227
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,333
But you know what?

228
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,458
I will confirm it
once I discuss her case with my madam.

229
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,208
How come Franca was the first to hear?

230
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,791
Ah, I don't know,

231
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,041
but you know that all bad news
comes from that woman's mouth.

232
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,750
She must be lying.

233
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,500
Well, she swears that she saw them
with her two naked eyes.

234
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,291
So where is Rose now?

235
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,875
She left.

236
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,958
I only came to tell you
because you're her friend.

237
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,708
Thank you.

238
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,958
Had I been around,
she wouldn't have done it.

239
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:58,958
How?

240
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,541
I would have calmed her down.

241
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,541
-Hmm?
-Mm.

242
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,666
It was about time.
Rose does not know how to control herself.

243
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,708
How?

244
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,208
And Salako has been
letting her get away with it?

245
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,291
-That's it.
-How?

246
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,000
We should pray for her.

247
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,125
Pray for who?
Everybody knows she's Salako's girlfriend.

248
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,000
-Ah, is that new?
-[clears throat]

249
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,125
Ah, Tolani, how are you?

250
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,500
-Have you heard?
-Heard what?

251
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,000
Don't bear false witness.

252
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,708
Face your food, pastor.
Who is talking to you?

253
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,833
It's Rose's concern
and no one else's. [tsk]

254
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,875
Just be talking anyhow.

255
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,333
Me, I like her, I'm just concerned.

256
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,875
[relaxing music playing on speakers]

257
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,041
Mm.

258
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,125
Who else was there apart from Ignatius?

259
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,500
Um, Godwin. But he was all right.

260
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:03,666
Hakeem too was trying to open his mouth,
but Franca was the actual devil.

261
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,416
She was lucky
I wasn't there to deal with her.

262
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,916
It's her type that sleeps
with useless men like Salako.

263
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,166
Why did he sack you?

264
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,958
Because he is a bastard.

265
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,583
It won't end well for him,
the stress he put me through at that bank.

266
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,125
He touched me up and down.

267
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,541
Did you slap him?

268
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,875
Why does it matter?

269
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,416
[sighs]

270
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,916
Why now Rose? Why?

271
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:32,791
Tolani, because women like me and you
never get justice in this country.

272
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,041
Only criminals get justice.

273
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,583
Look at him.
Can't you see how corrupt he is?

274
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,000
He steals from the bank,
steals from the customers

275
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,791
and still collects bribes.

276
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,541
Him and that snake Umar.

277
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,333
[sucks teeth] Forget that one.

278
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,916
Umar is a part of it, he's a part too!.

279
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,500
Those bad debt letters you've been typing,
you think they'll be repaid?

280
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,833
Salako opens an account for a big man

281
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,416
and Umar gives the big man a loan.

282
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,750
-Hmm.
-Big man then gives them both a cut.

283
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,708
But the three of them know
the loan will never be repaid.

284
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,375
What you think happens
with those dormant accounts?

285
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,500
Salako is using them
as his personal accounts.

286
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,375
It's why he's early every morning.

287
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,416
So he can steal from them.

288
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,708
The government ministers steal,
even the president steals.

289
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,375
Then you toil and work hard,

290
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:23,541
but still can't afford to buy meat
to put in your lunch in the afternoon.

291
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,125
If I ever see that man again,
I will deal with him.

292
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,250
Mm.

293
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,166
[chuckles]

294
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,458
Please my sister, just take it easy.

295
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,291
My work of seven years. Seven years.

296
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,583
Show me one person
that can type faster in that bank.

297
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,666
Show me one person whose shorthand
is better than mine. Show me!

298
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,875
[sighs]

299
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,750
So what are you going to do now?

300
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,125
Don't worry. I'll take care of myself.

301
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,666
[clicks tongue]

302
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,625
Our rent is due.

303
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,041
I'll talk to Vali-- Violet.

304
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,208
Violet?

305
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,291
Are you sure?

306
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,750
Yes, if I can't ask her for money,
who else can I ask?

307
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,125
Ah. Okay.

308
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,625
[sighs]

309
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,750
[solemn music playing]

310
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,708
Have you eaten?

311
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,583
I don't feel like eating.

312
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:37,958
[sucks teeth]

313
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,625
-[speaking Italian] Come stai?
-[speaking Italian] Va bene.

314
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:49,625
Bellissima.

315
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,666
Oh, grazie, you speak Italiano?

316
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,833
Ah, I stayed in Italy.

317
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,000
You know, when I was in Italy,
I went to their "Vasasi" store.

318
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,333
-Versace.
-Ah.

319
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,583
Ah! Mamma mia, very good fashion.

320
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,083
Ah, I'm telling you, I stayed in Italy.

321
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,250
All right.

322
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,916
Yes.

323
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,916
-[laughing]
-Morning.

324
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,250
Aunty.

325
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,666
Morning sister Vio.

326
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,166
Good morning. Rose. Why are you here?

327
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,291
I need to talk to you.

328
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,708
Go wait for me.

329
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,708
Go wait for me now.

330
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,291
-Hi there.
-Hey, aunty.

331
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,541
-I'll be back soon, hmm? Pronto.
-[chuckles]

332
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,083
Mabel!

333
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,125
You see this one? Hmm? Just this one.

334
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,750
-Yes.
-You finish loosening it.

335
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,416
-Okay, ma.
-I'll be right back.

336
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,958
-Pronto.
-No problem.

337
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,041
Rose, what is it?

338
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,541
I want to borrow some money.

339
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,916
-I don't have money.
-How?

340
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,833
Hmm.

341
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,458
I don't have money.

342
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,208
Why didn't you ask Tolani?

343
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,916
Why would I ask her? Is she my relative?

344
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,125
Anyway, I don't have money.

345
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,083
I've come all this way!

346
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,833
-You should've called.
-What phone am I going to use?

347
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,541
-Aren't there call centers in your area?
-There are no working lines in my area.

348
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,125
Rose, I don't have money.

349
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,708
I don't have. Can you hear me?

350
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,541
The last time I borrowed you money,

351
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,541
it took you a long time
to return my money.

352
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,916
Therefore,
I don't have money to give you.

353
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,208
But Fedele sends you money every month.

354
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,208
For his daughter.

355
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,500
In foreign currency?

356
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,166
See, we are talking of lira.

357
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,666
Lira is not that strong.

358
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,875
It's not like we are talking
about dollars or pounds sterling.

359
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,083
But you have money to live in Keffi
and to rent a shop in Onikan?

360
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,541
Will you behave yourself?

361
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,208
I don't have time for this nonsense.

362
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,916
What is the matter with you?

363
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,333
I don't have money to lend you.

364
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,791
The only thing I can do is,

365
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,708
give you a little bit, you know,
something to get you by.

366
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,250
Sisi said we should help each other.
That's what she said.

367
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,291
Sisi can say whatever she likes!

368
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:27,000
-Really!
-Yes! What? It's the truth.

369
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,625
Ah-ah. Sisi can say whatever she wants.

370
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,875
That's small town talk. Let me tell you.

371
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,125
Sisi had so many children.

372
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,500
In fact, too many
and she can't afford them.

373
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,125
If it wasn't for my father,
I wouldn't have gone to Italy.

374
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,875
I wouldn't have met Fedele.
I wouldn't have had my child.

375
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,458
In fact, I wouldn't be sitting here today.

376
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,208
Vio, you'll never see me insulting Sisi.

377
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,500
My dad paid for my secretarial studies,
if you don't know.

378
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:57,708
I know. That's the only thing
he could help her with.

379
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:02,166
Don't insult my father, don't try it.
Don't even go there.

380
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,833
-My father was a generous man.
-Hm.

381
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,083
Generous indeed.

382
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:10,000
The only thing is
that his salary as a teacher

383
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,583
didn't afford him any luxuries.
Just the little things--

384
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:16,166
Ah, Violet you have--
you have a bad mouth!

385
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,416
You talk nonsense.

386
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,791
-What about yours?
-Sisi said it! You have a bad mouth.

387
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:23,166
And yours isn't uncouth?
Look at you, hypocrite. Am I your senior?

388
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,541
Don't be rude to me.

389
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,166
But really,
weren't we brought up together?

390
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,541
Tell me, were we not raised the same way?

391
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,750
Didn't we drink garri and water together?

392
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,166
Hmm? Rose, I don't have money.

393
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,166
Am I clear?

394
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,500
Oh, so now you've become
a big woman in Lagos.

395
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:42,916
[chuckles]

396
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,708
No problem. Everybody has their time.

397
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,958
I don't have money.

398
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,458
Chukwuebuka!

399
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,625
[kid] Ma!

400
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,875
Bring what I asked you to bring for me.

401
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,291
♪ If you want to marry a woman ♪

402
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:13,458
-Mama Chidi.
-Please go and bring the second one.

403
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:15,291
[chuckles] Mrs. Durojaye.

404
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,916
-How are you?
-I'm fine, welcome.

405
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,208
I admire your car.

406
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:22,583
It takes you out and brings you back.

407
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:28,958
It really helps.
Mama Chidi, to have a car really helps.

408
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,041
Hey, I can't forget when
the last one finally broke down.

409
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:35,083
Ah! Mama Chidi, I struggled.

410
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,125
But we thank God. We thank God.

411
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:45,833
My sister, maybe one day
Papa Chidi too will be able to buy one.

412
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,791
What are you thinking? It's fairly used.

413
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,833
-Really?
-Yes. Imported.

414
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:58,083
My sister, I'll be happy with any one,

415
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:01,291
whether it's used or an imported car.

416
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:04,041
As long as it's from overseas, it's okay.

417
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:10,000
But see, you will have to wait
till after twelve noon

418
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,458
on sanitation day before you go out.

419
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,708
And if you must get
a number plate license,

420
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:19,708
it has to be the type of mine,
an odd number.

421
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:23,166
So that you can at least
go out three times in a week.

422
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:28,250
Even me during weekdays,
I wake up very, very early.

423
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,458
As early as 5:00 a.m. to go out.

424
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:34,250
Because anything after 7:00,
that's another problem.

425
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,333
Hmm.

426
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,916
That is a good thing.

427
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,500
-Ah-ah. Rose. Welcome. How are you?
-Mama Chidi.

428
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,375
I'm fine, how are your children?

429
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:48,625
We thank God.
We're planning to cook beans today.

430
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,208
How is Papa Chidi?

431
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:54,083
He's fine, thanks to God. Welcome, eh.

432
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,375
Well done.

433
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,791
[sucks teeth]

434
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,333
Rubbish.

435
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,250
An extremely useless individual.

436
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,750
Worthless and no use to anyone.

437
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,375
-Okay, Mama Chidi.
-Hm?

438
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,291
I'm going inside.

439
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,791
Let me go and remove my drawers,
I'm sweating.

440
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:20,791
Okay.

441
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,458
Chukwuebuka!

442
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,833
What a pity.

443
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:29,708
Not at all,
Vio is wicked. Sisi told me already.

444
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:32,375
She said if Vio
saw her injured on the road,

445
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,041
she'd leave her to die.

446
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,583
At least she should send money
to your mother now.

447
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,583
What? What are you saying?

448
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:43,750
Sisi has never gotten even one single kobo
from Vio since she came back from Italy.

449
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,750
For real?

450
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:45,916
Not even one!

451
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:50,500
She only knows how to shout "mamma mia,"
when she has customers.

452
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,708
Violet.

453
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,791
She doesn't want anyone
to know we're sisters.

454
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:58,416
She doesn't understand any Italian!
She doesn't, she's just pretending.

455
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,875
And she met Fedele
when she was cleaning his house!

456
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,250
Hmm?

457
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,250
Please, I'm starting to have a headache.

458
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,958
This world…

459
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,791
I'm thinking maybe
I should even be grateful.

460
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,791
That Mrs., uh…

461
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,083
Durojaye…

462
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,000
Whatever she calls herself. Her.

463
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,083
One day she'll kill one of her children.

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,458
When I passed her just now,

465
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,083
she was giving me the stink eye,
like I stole her husband.

466
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,458
-[laughs]
-No wonder the man divorced her.

467
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:32,833
Who wants to wake up
to such an angry face every day?

468
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,875
One day she'll kill one of her children.

469
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,291
Is there any food?

470
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:53,416
Umar. That is it,
see me later in my office.

471
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,916
-Tolani.
-Yes, sir?

472
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,250
See me in my office.

473
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:02,375
Mr. Salako has requested
that you be transferred downstairs,

474
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,458
to work with him.

475
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,208
Why, sir?

476
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:11,541
He wants someone from within the bank
to replace his secretary.

477
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,166
I've told him that you'll
be available from tomorrow.

478
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,541
I want you to clean out your desk today
and report to him downstairs.

479
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,375
But I have plenty of letters to type, sir.

480
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:23,916
What letters?

481
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,250
Bad debts.
There's so many of them and…

482
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,500
Sir, please, I like it here in loans.

483
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:33,875
Mr. Salako has requested
that you be transferred.

484
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,875
[knocking]

485
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,583
[knocking]

486
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:53,583
Yes.

487
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,291
Come in.

488
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,708
Hmph!

489
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,583
Alhaji Umar said
I should report to you sir.

490
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,916
Hm, yes, um, Miss Ajao.

491
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,416
I had a meeting with him regarding,

492
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,625
uh…

493
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,208
my former secretary. What's her name?

494
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,666
What's her name again?

495
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,416
-Rose Adamson, sir.
-Mm-hmm!

496
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:33,833
I think you are the suitable person
for that… office.

497
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,750
Because whenever I see you,
you always appear neat.

498
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,500
Very neat.

499
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,750
Eh. And you're a Yoruba girl?

500
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,666
-Yes sir.
-Okay.

501
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,500
Please, you are from where?

502
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,208
Makoku, sir.

503
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,958
Makoku. Makoku interior I guess.

504
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,666
We're not interior people.
We're Egba, sir.

505
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,583
Huh?

506
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:02,958
Did you say Egba?

507
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,125
Yes, sir.

508
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,166
Okay. What does your father do?

509
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,875
My father was a drummer sir.

510
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,083
[drumming]

511
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,291
Was a drummer? Oh.

512
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,583
He's passed on. What a pity.
May God grant him heavenly rest.

513
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,041
Thank you, sir.

514
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,458
God grant him heavenly rest.
And your mother?

515
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:35,041
My mother makes adire.
She's a cloth dyer sir.

516
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,500
Hm. I see. I see.
Whatever, they raised you well.

517
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:50,958
You have manners.

518
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,750
Anyway, what about your diction?

519
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,333
Diction, English.

520
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,708
My diction, sir?

521
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:01,500
Your diction!
Ah, don't you understand English?

522
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,000
How do you… do you speak and write?

523
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,000
My diction is fine, sir.

524
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:10,208
Uh, what… whatever,
let's give it to Rose. Hm.

525
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:16,125
Her English grammar, diction

526
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,958
were excellent. Very excellent.

527
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:24,416
Anyway, you will go to her desk now,
clean the desk for me.

528
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,750
Because the last time
I tried to check the desk,

529
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:31,166
the whole place looked horrible.

530
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,583
Like, uh, she packed a lot of juju there.

531
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:37,083
-Juju?
-Yes, juju. Hmm.

532
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,458
Like you don't know what juju is.

533
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,083
-Go and clean the place.
-[phone ringing]

534
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:48,458
Hello.

535
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,083
Ah.

536
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,958
Hello, sir.

537
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,458
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

538
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,500
You don't know my job,
you don't know what my job entails.

539
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,833
You don't know anything.

540
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:11,041
There's nothing that entails
anything in that… in that bank.

541
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,458
All the work I was doing for Alhaji Umar
last week, he didn't even know.

542
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,375
What could it possibly entail?

543
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:20,583
You say hello to a customer,
the customer says hello to you. Finish!

544
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,791
No. Tolani, no.

545
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:26,666
Look, when a customer
comes in or they call on the phone,

546
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,291
the way you interact with them

547
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,916
should make them
relaxed and very comfortable.

548
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,291
I did all this there.

549
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:34,958
I don't want to.

550
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,916
So why not tell him
you didn't want the job?

551
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,083
[scoffs]

552
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,083
How?

553
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,625
This man knows what he's doing.

554
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,250
He's doing it because he knows
we live together.

555
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,000
He wants me to come and beg him.

556
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,125
Over my dead body.
I'll never go beg him.

557
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,875
Is he that scared of juju?

558
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,958
That man? He's worse than an illiterate.

559
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,541
And that smell in his office, what is it?

560
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,875
He farts. He farts a lot.

561
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:01,958
[laughs]

562
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,791
You'll get used to it.

563
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:06,666
And you'll get used to it
when he starts touching you.

564
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,208
God forbid.

565
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,708
[melodic pop song playing]

566
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:43,958
Johnny, Johnny.

567
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,833
Ah, Rambling Rose!
Don't contaminate this contraband.

568
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,458
You never ask after me.

569
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,916
-Do you ask?
-This is my only wife in Lagos.

570
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,625
So tell me,
where are you guys rambling to today?

571
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,833
We want to buy shoes, but your shoes
are always too expensive…

572
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,708
Is that so!

573
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,250
So that's why you never patronize me.
No problem.

574
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,541
This is my friend,
I'm taking him to a boutique.

575
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,583
You know he doesn't shop around here.
We need to upgrade.

576
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,666
Hello.

577
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,291
Eh, O to the C! OC Money!

578
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:14,916
You see these two,
they're my favorite customers in Lagos.

579
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,208
Now see this one,
he's an original fly guy!

580
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,125
He just came back from United States.

581
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,375
-Of America?
-Is there another one?

582
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,541
Really? Okay then.

583
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,750
-This one is your size.
-Buy these for me.

584
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,333
-You mean this?
-Hm.

585
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,833
Baby, see.

586
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,250
Austerity measures.

587
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,041
Ah, Johnny, you haven't changed,
you're still stingy,

588
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,291
Please leave my shoes.

589
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,166
-How much is it?
-Five naira, that seven naira.

590
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,000
-How much?
-I'll pay two naira fifty kobo.

591
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,125
Seven naira.

592
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:43,750
I'm paying two naira, 50 kobo.

593
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,458
-Did you tell her five?
-It's seven.

594
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,625
It's seven naira.

595
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,250
-Five naira.
-Five for the two of them.

596
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,166
No. Okay, you pay six naira.

597
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,166
-We don't have that. Two naira, 50 kobo.
-No.

598
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,958
-Hey Johnny!
-Yes?

599
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,500
No time, you know. I'll pay.

600
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,666
Huh?

601
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,041
-OC Money!
-It's all good.

602
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,541
Okay! Put it in a bag.

603
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:06,458
Thank you. My name is Rose.

604
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,583
My name is OC.
But my friends call me OC Money.

605
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:14,250
What are you doing with this person,
he doesn't like spending money.

606
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,166
[laughs] He's a cool guy,
you know, very cool guy.

607
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,833
Can I come visit you?

608
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,416
Sure.

609
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:27,000
All right, you should
give me your address.

610
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,958
-My address?
-Yes.

611
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,583
-So, we'll see.
-Yeah.

612
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,125
-Take care.
-Yeah.

613
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,500
He's nice.

614
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,041
-Who?
-Uh-uh.

615
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,666
-OC now.
-You don't know him, let's go.

618
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,250
You?

619
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,333
Come in.

620
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,291
Please make yourself comfortable.

621
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,625
Here we are.

622
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,666
So what can I offer you?

623
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,458
Beer.

624
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:04,750
What is it?

625
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,625
Let me get you some wine instead.

626
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,708
No, I only drink beer.

627
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:13,791
It's not ladylike.

628
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,166
Wine is better, trust me.

629
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,416
I'll drink whatever you give me.

630
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,416
Wine it is. I'll be right back.

[upbeat music playing]

632
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,833
Ah, you should've seen OC's house,
there's no gadget he doesn't have.

633
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:45,791
And he's as generous as my father.

634
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,041
Can you imagine?

635
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:53,041
When I was there, what's his name…
Johnny came by.

636
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,083
He started asking me questions
when OC went to the kitchen.

637
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,958
-Okay, so feel free okay?
-Okay.

638
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,916
Rose,

639
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,833
what is going on
between you and him?

640
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,875
How is it your business?

641
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,875
I just ignored him. Nonsense.

642
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,333
He claims he is into import and export

643
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,166
and yet he never bought me
even a drink when we were dating.

644
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,583
But now he wants to monitor me,
asking silly questions. Please.

645
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,875
OC is his friend.

646
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:34,833
And so?

647
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,000
Hasn't it been long enough since we dated?

648
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:42,125
He doesn't own me,
I can do anything I want.

649
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,833
He probably has many girlfriends.
You know how he is.

650
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,083
Please, let me drink my wine.

651
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,708
OC said I should stop drinking beer.

652

Uh. Please, uh, get me that file.

Here it is, sir.

Thank you.

OC it was a struggle coming here today.

660
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:40,875
I really struggled.

661
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:44,416
So if you want to see me again,

662
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,625
you'll have to start giving me taxi money.

663
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:55,083
And I mean the proper taxis,
not those rickety ones.

664

That's no problem, you know.

665
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,916
Thank you.
Because I have no money left.

666
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,333
I don't even have money for rent.

667
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,958
That's no problem too,
I'll take care of that.

Thank you.

669
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:25,041
You know, while you're at it,
don't you think you need new shoes?

670
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,458
Uh-uh. Why?

671
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,583
Your shoe is old.

672
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,291
From trekking now.

673
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:37,708
Your friend was right, you know?
You should start wearing better shoes.

674
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,625
Who has time
to wear high heels everywhere?

675
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,083
I'm only offering.

676
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,708
If you want to buy, no problem.

677
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:58,333
Buy, I won't say no. As long as it's free.

678
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,375
Not exactly.

679
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,250
How?

00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,875
[tense music builds]

681
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,250
You will have to do something for me.

[humming]

683
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,375
Your shoes are nice.

684
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:26,458
Really? You can have any you want.

685
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,250
They're not my size.

686
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:33,750
Just tired. Today I did a lot of shopping.

687
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:36,458
I shopped.

688
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,916
When are you going
to start looking for another job?

689
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,791
Uh-uh. Why?

690
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:47,916
I'm just saying, you don't want
to get used to being at home for too long.

691
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:50,916
Ah, I'm not… I'm not looking for a job.

692
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,541
I don't want to work again.

693
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:55,666
OC said I shouldn't work,
that he'll take care of me.

694
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,791
He even asked me to move in with him.

695
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,041
What?

696
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,166
But I told him I wasn't ready.

697
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,375
He said I'm the kind of woman
he would like to marry.

698
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,416
-When?
-Today.

699
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,666
After how many days of knowing you?

700
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,000
Eh.

701
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:20,458
Let me tell you something.
You are not a child!

702
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:23,708
You cannot move into a house
with a man you barely know.

703
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,625
Or marry him.

704
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:28,416
Anybody who does that kind of thing
is clearly asking for trouble.

705
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,416
No quarrel, is it your problem?

706
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:34,208
Is it not my trouble?

707
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,166
It's your problem.

708
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,416
Silly girl.

709
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,291
Why are you so upset about it?

710
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,416
You know what baffles me
the most about this whole thing?

711
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:53,375
It's that it's been just three weeks
since they started dating.

712
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,250
He's already talking about marriage.

713
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:05,541
Look, Tolani, why don't you stop focusing
on those people's business?

714
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,208
Okay.

715
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:10,458
She doesn't work, she doesn't do anything.

716
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:14,083
And she's always eating my food.

717
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,333
Did she just start eating your food today?

718
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:18,375
She didn't just
start eating my food today,

719
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:21,541
but what if she moves out
and is no longer paying the rent?

720
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,750
What would I do? Where would I go?

721
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:28,000
Okay. Whenever I ask her where he lives,

722
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:31,666
she says it's in Ikeja,
it's in Along, or something else.

723
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,333
She has never once told me where he lives.

724
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:39,083
She's never told me! What is Rose hiding?

725
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:42,000
-What exactly is she hiding?
-Why don't you just ask her?

726
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:45,375
I should ask her? Have you not heard
anything I've been saying?

727
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:49,375
All this, I'm tired.

728
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,875
I'm tired of all this stress.

729
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:56,208
That reminds me,
the business you wanted to do,

730
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,583
is your uncle giving you money for it?

731
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,125
No.

732
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:04,458
I don't want him in my business at all.

733
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:06,875
Why?

734
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:11,083
When I establish this business,
starts going well, bringing in money,

735
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,791
it'll mean I'm set and can be on my own.

736
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:15,250
Ah, that's good but,

737
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,208
where will you get money?

738
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:20,875
What do you think
I've been running around for?

739
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:25,166
But, it would be too late.

740
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:29,583
That would take too long.

741
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:33,708
I suggest I give you
what little I have left of my savings,

742
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:38,166
so you can add it
to the money you have. Eh?

743
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,875
And then you can start from there.

744
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:46,500
Tolani, I didn't come here
to beg for money.

745
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:50,291
I know, Sanwo, I know you didn't
come here to beg for money,

746
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,500
but it'll take too long.

747
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,416
Too long before you have enough .

748
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,916
Let me help you out.

749
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,625
[faint clapping and singing]

750
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,916
What is happening?

751
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,750
-Ayo!
-Yes?

752
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,916
-What are you doing there?
-I'm playing.

753
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,666
You're playing?
Look, let your mother catch you there,

754
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,208
you'll be in real trouble.

755
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,666
You're playing. Where is Philomena?

756
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,000
I don't know.

757
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:27,166
You don't know? Doesn't she know
how much your mother pays her

758
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,416
to watch over you guys,
and you're playing all over the place.

759
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,458
Would you get off
that place you're playing?

760
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,666
These children!

761
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,750
What is it? Should I let him hurt himself?

762
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,625
Um…

763
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,208
-Tolani.
-Hmm?

764
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,750
The money you talked about earlier,

765
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:55,500
uh, I have thought about it.

766
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,583
Ah.

767
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,583
And…

768
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:05,541
I'll take whatever amount you have.
And I'll pay it back.

769
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:06,708
Uh-huh.

770
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,458
But, I can't take the money from you,

771
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:13,958
when you're like this.

772
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,083
I hear you.
I'll calm down until you're done.

773
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,291
[gentle music playing]

774
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,916
I'll be expecting you.

775
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,333
You can have it.

776
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,958
-Thank you.
-Bye.

777
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,708
Can you get me the file, please?

778
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,375
What file, sir?

779
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:46,000
Hmm, quarterly budget.

780
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,583
[tense music playing]

781
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,583
-Mr. Salako!
-Who is that?

782
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,708
Can't you knock?!

783
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:07,791
Can't you knock?
See how her mouth is open.

784
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:10,875
-I thought you said I should come in.
-No! I didn't say so.

785
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,625
I didn't say. When did I say so?

786
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,416
Get out! Get out.

787
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,291
What's that?

788
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,041
What can I do for you?

789
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:22,083
There's a messenger from First Bank,
they asked to see you.

790
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,750
Mm, tell the person to wait.
Tell him to wait.

791
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,541
I'm busy. And let me warn you,

792
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:32,000
next time you, you come in like that,
I will sack you.

793
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,833
Come on, go, go. Leave my office.

794
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,583
-Okay.
-Mm.

795
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:40,708
Get the hell out.
Keep on walking aimlessly.

796
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,458
Be going!

797
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:44,125
Where's the file?

798
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,208
-Here's the file, sir.
-Let me have it!

799
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,333
Look at her.

800
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,375
Always walking seductively,
shaking her butt.

801
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,791
I know what you're doing.

802
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,958
Tolani, this is what I'm saying.

803
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:08,375
You see, whatever the world about a person
is not always who the person is.

804
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,541
The person might not
see themselves in that light.

805
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,000
Let me give you an example.

806
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:17,666
If a man comes and says,

807
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:24,125
"Ah, this girl is well mannered,
she's virtuous, she's honorable."

808
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:28,583
Within you, you know it's possible
that you're not all those things.

809
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,500
Do you understand?

810
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,583
The point I'm trying to make is this.

811
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:37,291
If you know you're well-mannered,
virtuous, and honorable,

812
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:40,250
you make sure to protect your reputation.

813
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,166
You won't let life or any man
take it away from you.

814
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,791
-Do you understand?
-I understand, Mom.

815
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:47,333
-Are you sure?
-I understand.

816
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:53,041
[toilet flushing]

817
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,541
OC.

818
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:57,750
What kind of job do you do
that you make this much money?

819
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,375
Hmm?

820
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:06,958
I'm asking because
I want to make my own money.

821
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,125
You have a passport?

822
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:13,416
-Passport? Yes I have plenty of passports.
-No, not that type.

823
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,625
An international passport.

824
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:18,583
Oh.

825
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,250
No, I don't.

826
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,041
Why?

827
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,000
You should've told me.

828
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:32,125
I've been suspecting
that you were doing something illegal.

829
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,541
But I didn't know what.

830
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:38,041
I thought you were, um,
trading dollars on the black market.

831
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,291
I knew it was something illegal.

832
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,125
Listen, OC,

833
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:45,666
I can do it.

834
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,208
I'm not afraid.

835
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,458
I can do it.

836
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,083
Trust me.

837
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:55,916
Listen, when I was growing up,

838
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,208
all these stupid old men
started touching me,

839
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,416
but I learned how to fight them.

840
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,916
But poverty?

841
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:09,291
That's a different thing altogether.
And I don't want to face it again.

842
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:13,041
I… I do not really know
how to put this…

843
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:16,208
but, uh, certain information
just reached my attention,

844
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,000
and I want to know if it is true.

845
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,291
What information?

846
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:24,208
Were you and Salako
caught in flagrante delicto?

847
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,291
What does that mean?

848
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:30,125
Well you know… you know, um…

849
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,291
Well?

850
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,250
Tell Franca to stay away from me.

851
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,750
That is not… I mean,
that is not part of the issue here.

852
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:40,833
Really? Then you are like her then.

853
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,833
Tolani!

854
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:46,416
I'm sorry, uncle, I don't have
time for this. Please, beans for me.

Ayo!

860
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,333
Ayo!

861
00:54:58,416 --> 00:54:59,625
Eh!

862
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:02,125
Ayo! Eh!

863
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,583
We need a longer stick.

864
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:06,250
This is the only stick we could find.

865
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:09,250
Go across the road,
there are bamboo sticks there.

866
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,833
I don't want those people to know
what is happening in this compound.

867
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:15,541
Go there, don't let them know
what's happening here.

868
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:19,500
Please help me go
and collect a longer stick.

869
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,000
Ayo.

870
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,416
Tolani!

871
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,458
Where is the stick?

872
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:26,708
It is taking time.

873
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,041
Ayo fell into the septic tank.
We're trying to get him out.

874
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,750
That Philomena is wicked.

875
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:33,208
-Where is she exactly?
-She ran away.

876
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:37,875
If I see her, I'll personally beat her up.
Then call the police to arrest her for me.

877
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,458
Ayo.

878
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:42,291
The stick now!
The stick. It's taking a long time.

879
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,375
They're bringing it.

880
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,458
Ayo!

881
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:58,750
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

882
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,375
Ayo!

883
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,458
Ayo!

884
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:12,750
Ayo, why?

885
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:15,875
-Ayo.
-Where is he?

886
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:17,833
-Ayo.
-Which Ayo?

887
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,333
I'm dead! Ayo!

888
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:24,333
I am dead! Help me bring him out!

889
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:26,791
-Don't let me lose my child, please!
-Mama Ayo!

890
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,750
Please!

891
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,250
-Mama Ayo!
-Help me carry him!

892
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,750
Mama Chidi!

893
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,041
Ayo.

894
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:38,416
Take her away from here now.
Help me bring him out!

895
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:51,291
Sorry for your loss.

896
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,791
-May we not have any more loss.
-So sorry.

897
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:58,625
Mother, They said I should do my hair
before school tomorrow.

898
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:01,833
God will comfort you.

899
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:03,791
Mother, why are you not talking?

900
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,833
Don't cry again.

901
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:08,416
Take heart. Sorry for your loss.

902
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,708
Stop crying. God will look…
God will be with you both.

903
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:16,458
Don't start crying again.

904
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:21,000
[horn honking loudly]

905
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,875
See that boy.

906
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,166
What is he doing there?

907
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,083
-What is he doing this time of night?
-Let's go find out.

908
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:36,208
What are you doing here at this time?

909
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:37,333
It's so late.

910
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,083
Isn't your mother looking for you?

911
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:41,375
Where did you come from?

912
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,041
-Get up.
-Get up and go home!

913
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,666
What are you all doing there?

914
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,541
Move out the way. Is that not Ayo?

915
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:50,583
I said move out of the way!
Or are you deaf?

916
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:51,958
Get away! Leave him alone.

917
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:53,916
Ayo.

918
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:56,833
What are you doing over there?

919
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:01,000
Your mother has been
looking for you all over the place.

920
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,333
All right. Let's go home.

921
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:03,541
She'll beat me.

922
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:06,750
Your mother won't beat you.
Don't worry, let's go home.

923
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,541
Come on.

924
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,750
-[yelling] My life!
-Ayo!

925
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:17,125
Have mercy on me. Please!

926
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:20,083
-It's okay.
-Help me get him, Mama Chidi.

927
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,708
God will help.

928
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:24,791
[Tolani] Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

929
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:27,791
-[man] Thank you God!
-Ayo!

930
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,833
Where did you find him?!

931
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,416
God, I thank you sir.

932
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,083
Congratulations on the good luck!

933
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,791
-Where did you find him?
-Ask him yourself.

934
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,666
-Ayo!
-[man] Thank you, God!

935
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:47,125
Thank you, God! Neighbors, thank you.

936
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,583
Ayo.

937
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:25,083
[crowd cheering on radio]

938
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,083
[indistinct voice over radio]

939
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:31,083
[announcer] Oh, my goodness!
Yes, Yemi is going closer.

940
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:34,750
Yes. He stands a chance
and… and… and it's a goal!

941
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,291
[all] Goal!

942
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:39,500
[cheering]

943
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:54,791
Take it.

944
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:16,125
-Wait a minute.
-Hmm?

945
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,958
What kind of business is this exactly?

946
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,208
Fine.

947
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,250
Do you remember my friend, Moshood?

948
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,875
Who?

949
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:32,166
Have you forgotten Moshood?

950
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:37,083
That man that drives
a Volkswagen Beetle around?

951
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:40,416
That's him.
You know he knows a lot of soldiers.

952
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,875
He imports dogs for them
to protect their homes.

953
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:48,416
Dogs like Dobermans, Alsatian, Rottweiler.

954
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,666
Imported dogs,
not all those local mongrels.

955
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:57,166
It's a very profitable venture.
I've done my research.

956
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:01,250
In fact, we should triple
the initial investment.

957
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,583
I can assure you. I've done my research.

958
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:07,208
That's good. Give me my money.

959
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:12,958
I took my savings from all the hard work
I've been doing since the year started,

960
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:15,000
and I gave it to you

961
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:18,125
and you're talking to me
about Moshood and dogs?

962
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,291
I thought you had a real business partner.

963
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,916
Or a good business plan.

964
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,708
Give me my money back. Thank you.

965
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:25,833
So, you don't even trust me.

966
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:29,750
After I told you
I had done all my research.

967
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:32,208
Okay. It's not like
I wanted your money before.

968
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,875
I'm not starving. Take.

969
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,250
All right, have some patience.
Don't be angry.

970
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:39,208
I'm just being cautious.

971
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,458
This is all my life savings.

972
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:43,208
I'm just scared. Don't be angry.

973
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,750
All right, take.

974
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:50,291
Take.

975
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,125
I trust you.

976
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:57,291
Make sure you give me my profit.

977
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:05,250
Okay, continue eating. Eat your food.

978
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:08,625
Eat. You have too much pride.

979
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:29,583
Stop being insolent.
I'm not going anywhere.

980
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,250
We must finish this discussion.

981
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:34,750
Finish what? What gives you the right
to come here and question me?

982
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:35,916
Really?

983
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,291
-My friend, get out.
-What is going on here?

984
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,416
Tell him to get out.

985
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,833
I'll go. But not until I say my peace.

986
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:44,166
Say what? Leave!

987
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:47,375
Is that so?
Your friend? She's not okay. She bit me

988
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:51,291
So you don't want to leave?

989
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,500
[grunts]

990
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:53,541
You don't want to leave?

991
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:57,208
Ah, look, don't mind her.
I only just told her to be careful of OC.

992
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:58,125
Why?

993
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,541
They had a big fight! It was explosive!

994
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,458
You should've heard
the things he said.

995
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:07,250
Okay, you don't want to leave?
Stay there! Stay there like a soldier.

996
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:09,958
You and I will have it out. Stay. Wait.

997
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:13,125
Ooh. You two broke up over a year ago,

998
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:16,041
and I'm still here settling
your quarrels. I'm surprised.

999
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,041
You should've heard the things OC said.

1000
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,041
You would be shocked.

1001
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:22,208
What things?

1002
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:23,833
Ah.

1003
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,666
Tell me.

1004
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:33,125
All right, let's put it this way.

1005
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:37,208
A man cannot respect you,
if he insults you like that.

1006
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:40,583
What! I can't believe
this is happening, you know.

1007
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:42,791
I must be dreaming, you know.

1008
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,708
-How dare you talk back, hungry whore!
-No, I--

1009
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:46,083
What…

1010
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:47,291
You hungry whore!

1011
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:50,041
-Did you hear what he called me?
-She's not good in bed.

1012
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,041
She's not good in bed you know!
You can't be compared to my girl

1013
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,000
-Natasha in Chicago!
-I've slept with better men than you!

1014
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,750
You can't be compared
to my girl Amanda in Atlanta!

1015
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:01,833
-Go back to Atlanta!
-You can't be compared to my girl Aliya

1016
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:04,250
-What are you doing here?
-You know!

1017
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,708
Babe, talk to your friend.

1018
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:08,125
I only met OC four years ago
and since that time,

1019
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,125
he's been living in the United States.

1020
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,708
I don't even know what he does there.

1021
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:16,583
-You said he was your friend!
-Yo! Everyone is my friend.

1022
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:22,375
-I'm surprised at you Johnny.
-Me? Is that so? She was my girl!

1023
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,250
She's the one that decided
to jump ship and date OC.

1024
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:26,916
You won't leave!

1025
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,833
-You should stay so I can stab you!
-What is wrong with you?

1026
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:33,083
-Please leave me! Leave me!
-Ah! What is wrong with you?

1027
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:37,250
I come in here and both of you
are acting like area boys.

1028
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:41,791
Nobody cares about Rose.
Every man just wants to use Rose.

1029
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:45,250
How many things has
Johnny ever bought for me?

1030
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:48,125
Coming here asking me questions,
monitoring my movement.

1031
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,500
Buy is not love.

1032
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,791
As for OC,

1033
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,208
if he really insults you like that,

1034
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,500
then he does not like you. You hear me?

1035
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:58,166
He does not like you.

1036
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,416
It's a mistake to be with that man.

1037
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,750
Don't tell me that. I know what I'm doing.

1038
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,458
A mistake is somebody that walks around

1039
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:06,750
thinking the world
would change because of them.

1040
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:10,666
Very good. You can do anything you want!

1041
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:15,416
With whoever you want. In fact,
you can go anywhere with whoever you want.

1042
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,791
But let me remind you,
I live in this house and I pay my rent.

1043
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:21,833
So if you give me problems,
I will give you problems back!

1044
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,458
I will give you problems back.

1045
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:25,916
Go, walk away
and don't hear what I'm saying.

1046
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,250
Look at the mess.

1047
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,041
[knocking on door]

1048
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:42,333
It's true that I don't have
anybody in Lagos to help me.

1049
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:48,375
But please, if I'm going to work for you,
don't insult me like that again.

1050
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:53,791
I'm begging you.

1051
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:49,125
-Miss Tolani Ajao.
-Yes, sir?

1052
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:53,041
Uh, please,
check that cabinet and get me a file.

1053
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,500
I'm sorry, I cannot, sir.

1054
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,625
-Why not?
-My leg.

1055
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:05,166
Your leg? What is wrong about your leg?
What happened?

1056
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,000
I fell down on the bus,
and it's paining me, sir.

1057
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:14,541
Oh. Stop being deceptive. You fell down?

1058
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:18,916
-You? You fall out from a bus?
-Yes sir.

1059
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,500
And you did not somersault?
You didn't somersault like a monkey?

1060
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:25,375
-Uh, when was this?
-Today.

1061
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,791
-Today?
-Yes, sir.

1062
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:28,500
Okay, show me.

1063
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:32,083
I twisted it, so you cannot see it.

1064
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:33,791
Show me.

1065
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,708
-This is it, sir.
-Ah.

1066
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:40,458
You're telling a lie.
It's a lie. You're lying.

1067
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:43,125
Ah! This thing did not happen today.

1068
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:45,916
This one did not happen today. Stop lying!

1069
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,625
It's still paining me, sir,
and I cannot bend until it heals.

1070
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,083
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

1071
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:54,083
All right. Then you take a memo for me.

1072
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:55,958
Yes, sir.

1073
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:01,625
I'm going to make you so miserable

1074
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:06,291
until you'll realize who is the boss,
you worthless thing.

1075
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,791
I'm here, sir.

1076
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:18,708
To personnel. Regarding Tolani Ajao.

1077
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:29,291
I wish to lay an official complaint
about my secretary.

1078
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:32,125
Miss Tolani Ajao.

1079
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:35,833
This morning,

1080
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:40,625
I asked her to get me
a file from my cabinet,

1081
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,250
and she refused bluntly.

1082
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:45,791
She became recalcitrant.

1083
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,333
How do you spell that, sir?

1084
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,291
Check your dictionary, dullard.
Didn't you go to school?

1085
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:58,000
And when you're asked you're quick
to say you understand English.

1086
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:01,583
But you don't know
how to spell a simple word.

1087
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:04,208
Recalcitrant. Ah.

1088
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,750
Make sure you type the memo for me.

1089
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,083
Yes, sir.

1090
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:16,000
Wait a minute, what do you call yourself?

1091
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,708
Eh? Who do you think you are?

1092
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:22,083
And you are just a commoner.
An ordinary person.

1093
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:26,750
-Is that also part of the memo, sir?
-That is your own cup of tea.

1094
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:30,125
If you don't know.
Write your response for records purposes.

1095
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,083
I will.

1096
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:36,666
Get out of my sight.
I'll make sure your job is history.

1097
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,958
I'm going to frustrate you.
You worthless thing.

1098
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:50,125
I notice a missing semicolon
in your response.

1099
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:53,083
I'll write it in, sir.

1100
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:55,958
And a misplaced predicate.

1101
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,416
Unfortunately,
you'll have to type it out again.

1102
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,333
Why?

1103
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:07,000
An employee cannot
amend internal documents by hand.

1104
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,541
If everyone does that,

1105
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:14,750
then we won't be able to differentiate
the originals from the fakes.

1106
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,833
I'll type it in
if that's what you want, sir.

1107
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:23,375
At any rate, I cannot
accept this response as it stands.

1108
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:26,541
Why not?

1109
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,166
Your allegations,

1110
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:35,208
they're rather… shocking.

1111
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:38,041
Of course!
What happened to me shocked me too.

1112
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:41,250
It's unprecedented
and I don't think I…

1113
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:43,125
I can file it.

1114
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:44,500
And why not?

1115
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:47,500
Mr. Salako is a married man.

1116
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,583
Your madam too is a married woman.

1117
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:52,250
And I've never heard of her
assaulting anyone.

1118
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,500
Look.

1119
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:59,416
For as long as I've been
supervisor in personnel,

1120
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:04,916
I have never discussed
this kind of case with her.

1121
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,916
Now, do you realize
the implications of what you're doing?

1122
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,333
Yes.

1123
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,375
All right.

1124
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:32,458
[Franca] I didn't even see Tolani
standing there. [laughs]

1125
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:35,708
Ah. So you don't even want
to speak to us any longer.

1126
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,625
Anyway, I understand.

1127
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:42,250
Anyone asking me now,
"What's happening to Tolani?"

1128
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,666
I just tell them "Leave her alone."

1129
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,666
"She's working for Salako now."

1130
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,958
Ah! And it cannot be easy.

1131
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:51,375
Ah! You know, learning a new--

1132
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,333
Be quiet! Keep your mouth shut!

1133
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:55,708
-Me?
-Yes.

1134
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,375
And if you don't keep quiet,
you will end up on this ground.

1135
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,791
-Are you talking to me?
-I'm talking to you.

1136
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:05,333
Don't say another word,
or you will live to regret it.

1137
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:07,375
Ah! Show her some respect now.

1138
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,583
Why are you threatening
to fight her in public?

1139
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:12,208
Hey! Uncle, please,
mind your own business. Okay?

1140
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,208
Mind your business.

1141
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,916
Look, let me tell you,
I'm happy you're all here.

1142
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:21,083
Listen to me,
because I will not repeat myself.

1143
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:24,166
Do not speak to me! Do not question me!

1144
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:27,208
Because I don't owe
any of you any explanation.

1145
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:28,791
I have filed my report.

1146
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:32,708
And you people can continue
to spread your stupid rumors.

1147
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,375
-Leave her alone.
-[Tolani] Nonsense.

1148
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,875
Just leave her alone. Look at her.

1149
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,125
Dismissing Ignatius like a little boy.

1150
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,250
God only knows who she's connected to.

1151
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,666
She might open her legs now
and get all of us all fired.

1152
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:48,708
Eh! You have word. Imagine.
Face in front, let's buy our food.

1153
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,583
Look at them, idiots.

1154
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:56,750
-I told you she's very wicked.
-Tolani?

1155
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,541
Hey! Can you see for yourself now?

1156
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,750
Imagine.

1157
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,000
Tolani.

1158
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:06,750
Leave Tolani there. She and Rose,
birds of the same feather.

1159
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:08,458
So please, let's buy food.

1160
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:09,541
Tolani!

1161
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,541
What?

1162
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:12,208
Don't you want to eat anymore?

1163
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:14,916
-What's your business?
-Oh, you want to fight me too?

1164
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:16,625
No.

1165
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:20,583
Why are you so bothered about Franca?
Let me tell you, she's an unhappy woman.

1166
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:23,041
Her husband beats her every day.

1167
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:25,666
[chuckles] I'm very happy to hear that.

1168
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,458
How can you say that now?
You should pray for your enemies.

1169
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,458
Why? So that they can destroy me.

1170
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,666
[scoffs]

1171
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,291
I'm sure you don't mean that.

1172
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,541
You're carrying a very heavy burden.

1173
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:38,291
I'm here to encourage you,
put your trust in the Lord.

1174
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:39,416
He's forever faithful.

1175
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,125
Anytime you're available,
I want to invite you to my church.

1176
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:47,083
Me, I'm not interested in going
to any born-again church.

1177
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:50,166
I'm not interested
in any revival or anything like that

1178
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,833
[laughs]

1179
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,916
I'm just inviting you now.

1180
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,666
As you're seeing me,
my father was an Ifa worshipper.

1181
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:00,750
Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that.

1182
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:02,083
Sorry to hear what?

1183
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,583
Nothing, oh. Nothing.

1184
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:08,458
It's just most people that I know
are either Christians or Muslims.

1185
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,625
Even if they worship
other gods on the side.

1186
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:15,500
Anyway, my mother is a Christian.

1187
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:17,416
And I was baptized and confirmed.

1188
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,625
Praise the Lord. That's so beautiful.
I salute you, my sister.

1189
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,916
-I salute you.
-All right, let's go and eat.

1190
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:38,375
-Ah, Tolani. How are you? Well done.
-Good afternoon. Yes, ma.

1191
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:43,041
-Listen, I've gotten a new job.
-Thank God.

1192
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,708
It's not easy.

1193
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:50,166
Bills just keep piling up
and it's all on me.

1194
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:53,875
Their father doesn't even
try to help out at all.

1195
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:55,875
He has gambled away all his money.

1196
01:14:55,958 --> 01:15:02,458
And the septic tank fiasco,
I had to pay the landlord to fix it.

1197
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:06,500
When there's too much to worry about,
the mind is never at peace.

1198
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:07,916
I'm tired.

1199
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,333
Sorry, ma. You just have to take it easy.
Take it easy.

1200
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:15,916
-Bye, ma.
-Thank you. These problems are too much.

1201
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:21,916
[Rose] How was work?

1202
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:27,083
Ah, I pity the woman.

1203
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,083
Only her.

1204
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:33,208
Septic tank issue, nurses strike,

1205
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:35,625
I feel sorry for her.

1206
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:36,916
What are you cooking?

1207
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:38,750
Banga.

1208
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,875
Ah-ah. Since when?

1209
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,666
OC likes it.

1210
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,625
[chuckles] Is that his?

1211
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,500
No, I bought it.

1212
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:52,916
Anyway,

1213
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,166
I'm going to enjoy the fan.

Good evening, here is the news at nine.

1217
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:04,708
-The woman…
-Mm!

1218
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,375
This is delicious.

1219
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:10,833
Mm, it's sweeter than
the previous ones I have made.

1220
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:19,583
This type of soup will cleanse
your stomach of all the rubbish in it.

1221
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:25,250
This one will send you
to OC's toilet for one full week.

1222
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:29,833
At least.
But I won't sweat when I'm there.

1223
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:31,625
The heat won't kill me in there.

1224
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,291
Ah, this is delicious.

1225
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:37,250
How is Sanwo?

1226
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:39,541
He traveled up north.

1227
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:44,166
Your man travels a lot.
Mm. He travels a lot.

1228

How is work?

01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:50,791
-Fine.
-Hm, and Salako?

1230
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,666
Ah. Is it that bad?

1231
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:08,750
Didn't I tell you? I told you right?

1232
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,666
Archibong reports to Salako,
so she can't challenge him.

1233
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,708
That's why I never bothered reporting.

1234
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:19,250
I'm sure she's thrown
your report away without reading it.

1235
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:21,250
I've told you already.

1236
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:24,666
And nothing will change
until you and I change it.

1237
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:27,958
How?

1238
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,125
OC, uh…

1239

Calm down, Just listen.
That's how he made his money.

-Are you listening?
-Ah!

1244
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,250
No, he doesn't do it himself.

1245
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:58,166
He uses girls like me and you.
Do you understand?

1246
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:02,916
We'll swallow the drugs, and he'll arrange
the travel plans for us to go overseas.

1247
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,916
We go and come back.

1248
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,458
Do you understand?

1249
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:11,750
And he pays us. Just one trip
and he will pay us 1,500 dollars.

1250
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:14,250
I'm not ashamed.

1251
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:19,583
I'm not ashamed.
You know what shames me? Poverty.

1252
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:22,125
And it should shame you too.

1253
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:25,333
I am tired of being poor. I am tired.

1254
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:29,083
You stay in a compound
where everywhere smells of shit.

You get on a bus and everyone
on it smells of… I don't know.

1256
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,500
Then you go to the office,
and there's a stinking useless man

No. I am tired and I'm done. I'm done.

1259
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:45,083
Rose, Salako or OC?

1260
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:46,250
Mm-hmm?

1261
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,125
Okay.

1262
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:54,333
I know that Salako is an oaf,
but that OC is a dangerous man!

1263
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:55,708
He didn't force me.

1264
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,750
I made up my mind by myself,
he didn't force me.

1265
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:02,916
I don't want to hear it. And I'm not poor.

1266
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,708
You're poor, my sister. You're very poor.

1267
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:09,708
You're poor. All of us are poor,
you're just too proud to admit it.

1268
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:13,500
If you want to do anything you like,
you can do it.

1269

Me, I don't take risks with my body.

1270
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:21,958
Wait, do you think that I, Rose,
that I want to die?

1271
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:26,583
So, the people that are dying,
they die for no reason?

1272
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:31,041
[laughs] They're very careless,
that's why they're dying.

1273
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:33,875
How can you be careful,
if you're swallowing drugs?

1274
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:39,708
Tolani, I've done my research.
I've done all the research. You won't die.

1275

You wrap the drugs well. Tight.

Then you make sure you don't eat or drink.
People do it every day.

-Come and go back to where you came from.
-I wasn't supposed to tell you.

you know where to find me.

This has been a disappointing end

to the match between Nigeria
and Saudi Arabia with a nil - nil draw.

1283
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:13,291
As you can see the Golden Eaglets
are looking very unhappy at the moment,

1284
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:17,833

But there were no dogs in them.

-I wanted to run after the man,

have the proper documentation so…

1332

I remember you warned me.
Tolani, I was duped.

1333
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,041
You were duped?
Of course, you were duped.

01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:10,541
Don't worry, she'll come around.

1550
01:36:22,291 --> 01:36:23,875
OC said there's no other way.

1551
01:36:28,708 --> 01:36:31,708
[upbeat religious music playing]

1552
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:41,125
It's a miracle.

1553
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:42,291
Verily.

1554
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:46,666
I was very worried
when I heard you were suspended.

1555
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:50,291
Don't worry,
I'll be back at work tomorrow.

1556
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:51,666
Ah, nice.

1557
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:56,208
I'm so glad you are able to make it.
Your boss needs serious prayers.

1558
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:57,708
When does this service end?

1559
01:36:58,791 --> 01:36:59,916
It's just two hours.

1560
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,166
Two!

1561
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,083
Hallelujah!

1562
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:11,416
[all] Amen!

1563
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,416
If you're happy to be in the presence
of the Lord, say hallelujah!

1564
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:17,458
[all] Hallelujah!

1565
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:22,166
[man] Hallelujah!

1566
01:37:24,916 --> 01:37:26,125
My God is good.

1567
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:27,458
[all] All the time!

1568
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,291
All right, can we sit down?

1569
01:37:31,833 --> 01:37:33,333
Father said to me…

1570
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:37,875
He said, "Fred, look at yourself."

1571
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:40,666
"Do you think it's because
you're so special,

1572
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:44,166
that you have been so blessed
that you fly first class?"

1573
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:46,333
[cheering]

1574
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:52,208
The secret to prosperity,
you don't need to go to worship some God.

1575
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:54,583
Just follow the rules of the law.

1576
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:57,166
-Hallelujah!
-Amen!

1577
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:01,625
If we turn our Bible to Acts 4:12.

1578
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:03,708
It says salvation!

1579
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:05,583
I didn't say it.

1580
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:08,958
The Holy Bible says salvation

1581
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:12,833
is found in no one else except who?

1582
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:15,458
-[all] Jesus Christ!
-[pastor] Jesus Christ! Amen!

1583
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:18,083
-[all] Amen!
-[woman] Amen, pastor!

1584
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:19,708
[man] Jesus!

1585
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:21,958
[yells indistinctly]

1586
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:23,000
Jesus!

1587
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:26,416
In the Book of John 14, and he says,

1588
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:31,083
"I am the way, the truth…"

1589
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:35,083
Good morning, Father.

1590
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:38,000
Ah, good morning. Did you sleep well?

1591
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:39,125
Yes, Father.

1592
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:40,958
What are you dressed up for?

1593
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:42,500
We're going to church.

1594
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,083
You're going to church?

1595
01:38:44,166 --> 01:38:46,125
You've started following them to church?

1596
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:48,125
-Yes.
-[chuckles]

1597
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:51,416
Ah. [laughs]

1598
01:38:51,916 --> 01:38:56,000
That's fine.
Let me just make one thing clear to you.

1599
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:59,583
I don't want you to tell your mother,
do you understand?

1600
01:38:59,666 --> 01:39:00,625
Yes, Father.

1601
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:02,458
If you have any problems,

1602
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:06,291
you should pray to Orunmila.

1603
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:08,375
Orunmila is the spirit of wisdom.

1604
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:16,500
All the deities that God created,
were created to help us.

1605
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:19,166
You see, Sango and Ogun,

1606
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:26,541
they are deities who help
give all men strength and courage.

1607
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:32,083
And you see Yemoja, ah,
she's a compassionate woman.

1608
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:36,166
Then you see the deity called Osun.

1609
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:38,791
Ah, she's the deity for children.

1610
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:45,041
She's the deity for plentiful children.
Anybody that's infertile, prays to Osun.

1611
01:39:45,125 --> 01:39:47,583
Keep it in mind,
I don't want you to forget.

1612
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:52,791
Jesus loves us so much. He gave his life!

1613
01:39:53,583 --> 01:39:55,625
So that you and I can survive.

1614
01:39:55,708 --> 01:40:02,333
But he asks for nothing,
except this token, offering and tithe.

1615
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:07,416
If you do that, you're gonna
start flying first class, amen!

1616
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,625
[all] Amen!

1617
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:12,125
You are gonna build that mansion tomorrow!

1618
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,666
Amen!

1619
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:17,166
You're gonna be driving a Mercedes Benz.

1620
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,291
Amen!

1621
01:40:20,291 --> 01:40:23,666
If you wanna have all that,
tell your brother, say I am blessed.

1622
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:25,458
[all] I am blessed!

1623
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:31,541
Tolani!

1624
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:36,958
What now?

1625
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:38,875
I'm sorry.

1626
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:41,041
It's okay. You are just overcome.

1627
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:45,166
I'm not. I'm just tired.
I want to go home.

1628
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:46,458
Home, why?

1629
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:49,208
Your pastor is brainwashing you.

1630
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:53,875
Every Sunday you sit there and
listen to him say all sorts of nonsense.

1631
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:55,458
He's already rich.

1632
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,208
But you're still giving him your money.
How does that make any sense?

1633
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:00,375
That's not for me to question.

1634
01:41:00,458 --> 01:41:03,750
Godwin, it is.
That's why God gave you a brain.

1635
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:06,458
Ah! It's already good enough
that you're a Christian,

1636
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:08,708
but why must you… I saw you there!

1637
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:10,500
Pretending to speak in tongues.

1638
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:13,000
Why? As if it's not bad enough,

1639
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:16,958
he's still condemning everybody else's
faith and saying one way is the only way.

1640
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,958
Why? Look, me, I'm going home.

1641
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:20,958
Bitch!

1642
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:41,666
I can't do it.

1643
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:43,416
Hm?

1644
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,208
Rose, I cannot do it.

1645
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:48,958
-Do what?
-[sighs]

1646
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:55,833
I can't do it.
Number one, I cannot swallow.

1647
01:41:55,916 --> 01:41:58,833
Ah-ah. Did you repent or what is it?

1648
01:41:59,625 --> 01:42:01,041
Number two,

1649
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:04,000
I must have been crazy

1650
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:07,000
to thought about doing
something like that.

1651
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:08,791
Over my mother's dead body.

1652
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:12,083
Never would I hide drugs
inside my stomach.

1653
01:42:12,583 --> 01:42:17,166
I would not jump on a plane,
and go and shit it out abroad.

1654
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:19,750
Never. I cannot do it.

1655
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,333
I cannot.

1656
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:24,875
-I had a revelation in that church.
-Hmm.

1657
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:29,916
People at the top will always take
advantage of people like you and me.

1658
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:33,208
Look at us.
We are working for an organization

1659
01:42:33,291 --> 01:42:35,916
that does not care about you or me.

1660
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,166
I cannot do this. Never.

1661
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,958
-Ah, Tolani.
-I cannot.

1662
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:45,208
It seems like this poverty
is making you crazy.

1663
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:48,166
See how you're
behaving like you're possessed.

1664
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:51,041
For weeks now,
you've been back and forth. What is it?

1665
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:53,916
Look, I don't care about OC.

1666
01:42:54,833 --> 01:42:57,250
It is you Rose that I'm concerned for.

1667
01:42:57,333 --> 01:43:00,750
Yet you're backing
out of the plan we both made.

1668
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:03,208
He will find somebody else. Eh?

1669
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:06,833
Just like he found you.
He will find somebody else.

1670
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:16,000
Don't go. Eh?

1671
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:20,333
It's not worth it.

1672
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:22,041
[gentle music playing]

1673
01:43:22,125 --> 01:43:23,041
Rose.

1674
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:26,125
We will find another job. You will see.

1675
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:28,625
What job? What job?

1676
01:43:29,791 --> 01:43:32,708
Do you know what
that bastard called me?

1677
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:33,958
A nobody.

1678
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,666
-But he called me a commoner too.
-Ooh.

1679
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,541
And you think that idiot

1680
01:43:38,625 --> 01:43:41,750
would write us a reference letter
to look for another job?

1681
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:42,625
[suspenseful music playing]

1682
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:11,750
-What is this?
-Salako.

1683
01:45:11,833 --> 01:45:13,541
Salako!

1684
01:45:13,625 --> 01:45:16,166
-Salako!
-What is wrong with you?

1685
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:19,291
How many times did I call you?
You have offended my creator,

1686
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:21,625
and you've also offended
my dead father's creator.

1687
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:28,291
The gods are now ready to give you
the punishment you deserve.

1688
01:45:28,375 --> 01:45:33,250
The gods are ready
to wreak havoc in your life.

1689
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:35,750
What is wrong with this girl,
for God's sake?

1690
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:37,875
I will take my leave next week.

1691
01:45:37,958 --> 01:45:40,958
-Can you get out before I--
-And you will not sack me!

1692
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:46,083
If you sack me,
your job will be in jeopardy.

1693
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:49,458
Your first male son will run mad.

1694
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:50,791
You are in trouble!

1695
01:45:50,875 --> 01:45:53,916
Your female child will get raped.

1696
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,958
She will get pregnant too.

1697
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:58,750
-You're unwell.
-She'll give birth to a bastard.

1698
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:02,375
-You'll get pregnant as well.
-As for the remaining children you have,

1699
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:06,250
any one of them
that is still in school won't finish.

1700
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:09,250
And if they have finished,
they will become aimless.

1701
01:46:09,333 --> 01:46:11,083
-Abomination!
-So shall it be.

1702
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:13,208
In the name of Jesus it won't-- Jesus!

1703
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:16,250
Witch! Spirit child!

1704
01:46:17,333 --> 01:46:23,166
Hey! Somebody help me, she'll kill me.
Where are my glasses?

1705
01:46:26,666 --> 01:46:29,791
Ah! Unfortunate person. Witch!

1706
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:50,000
Morning.

1707
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:56,250
[Tolani] He's busy.

1708
01:46:57,166 --> 01:46:58,416
But I need to see him.

1709
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:00,875
I said he's busy.

1710
01:47:00,958 --> 01:47:03,500
He personally asked me to see him.

1711
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:06,125
And he told me
he doesn't want to see anybody.

1712
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:09,166
So I can't go inside.
Is that what you're saying?

1713
01:47:10,333 --> 01:47:11,375
Is it?

1714
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:13,291
Okay.

1715
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:15,000
[scoffs]

1716
01:47:21,416 --> 01:47:24,083
-Yes?
-Sir, it's Tolani, sir.

1717
01:47:24,166 --> 01:47:26,208
Miss Franca is here to see you.

1718
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:29,750
Sir, it's pertaining to
the meeting we had yesterday.

1719
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:34,375
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow.
Um, thank you, Miss Ajao.

1720
01:47:39,166 --> 01:47:41,166
[playful music]

1721
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:44,791
Mm.

1722
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:46,625
[chuckles]

1723
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,250
I'm sorry.

1724
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:25,916
I'm the only one who would talk to you.

1725
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:28,458
So you pitied me?

1726
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:30,708
No.

1727
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:32,875
I misjudged your character.

1728
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:34,958
I'm sorry.

1729
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:41,291
Anyway, Jesus still loves you.

1730
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:46,708
Okay.

1731
01:48:47,375 --> 01:48:48,833
What is he still doing there?

1732
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:51,666
Maybe he's deliberating.

1733
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:53,791
Still?

1734
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:59,208
[announcer on radio] We were never
expected to make it this far but we have,

1735
01:48:59,291 --> 01:49:02,083
by virtue of our skill and athleticism.

1736
01:49:03,166 --> 01:49:07,250
He has won. He dribbles and it's…
and it's and it's in.

1737
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,875
And it's a goal!

1738
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:13,541
[all cheering]

1739
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:21,958
[Rose] Ah-ah! Tolani!
I can't believe this is you.

1740
01:49:23,666 --> 01:49:24,666
You!

1741
01:49:26,375 --> 01:49:28,625
You're worse than FIFA fans.

1742
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:32,375
My dear, I had to do it.

1743
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:34,500
If not he won't have let me go.

1744
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:38,916
True. It's good. He's overbearing.

1745
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,458
Too much.

1746
01:49:47,625 --> 01:49:49,500
Maybe I should
report you to the authorities,

1747
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,625
so that they can stop you at the airport.

1748
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:53,125
Which authorities?

1749
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:55,708
Same people that are behind it.

1750
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:58,083
-Hmm!
-Go and report.

1751
01:49:58,166 --> 01:50:00,500
-[laughs]
-I'll report you too.

1752
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:03,041
After all, you were a part of it
before you pulled out.

1753
01:50:03,125 --> 01:50:04,000
Uh-huh!

1754
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,291
[laughs]

1755
01:50:06,375 --> 01:50:08,291
-I'm no longer scared.
-Rose.

1756
01:50:09,916 --> 01:50:12,708
At least I'm not going to America,
I'm going to England.

1757
01:50:13,583 --> 01:50:15,333
There you just plead guilty.

1758
01:50:15,416 --> 01:50:18,541
They'll put you in prison
and give you a small sentence.

1759
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:20,500
You serve your time, the end.

1760
01:50:21,208 --> 01:50:23,375
But in America, ah…

1761
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:28,333
They throw you in a cell,
where they can sexually harass you.

1762
01:50:28,416 --> 01:50:29,666
[Tolani] Eh?

1763
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:31,250
God forbid.

1764
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:36,375
I hear that in Bangkok,
they throw them inside dungeons.

1765
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:38,541
Ah. They are worse than Africans.

1766
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:40,791
Eh! And as for the Arabs.

1767
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:43,000
Eh! Don't go near those ones.

1768
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:47,291
-They'll just behead you. Very strict.
-[Tolani laughs]

1769
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:50,208
I'm shocked. This is serious.

1770
01:50:53,541 --> 01:50:55,083
[Tolani sighs]

1771
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:59,458
My sister, please forgive me
for what I did the other day.

1772
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:03,666
-You know, my life.
-Hm.

1773
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:05,083
[gentle music playing]

1774
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:07,166
The things I've seen.

1775
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:10,416
The disappointment, everything, just…

1776
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:14,958
Just makes me behave
irrationally sometimes.

1777
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:17,000
[sighs]

1778
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:21,750
So, I'm sorry.

1779
01:51:24,708 --> 01:51:28,250
[gentle music rising]

1780
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:09,458
[knocking]

1781
01:52:09,541 --> 01:52:12,541
[snoring]

1782
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,583
[dramatic music rising gently]

1783
01:52:27,666 --> 01:52:29,916
[indistinct PA announcement]

1784
01:52:55,125 --> 01:52:56,250
[knocking]

1785
01:52:58,125 --> 01:52:59,958
[knocking continues]

1786
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:00,916
Uh-huh.

1787
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,250
Tolani, enter now. Come in.

1788
01:53:03,333 --> 01:53:04,750
Mama Chidi, good afternoon.

1789
01:53:04,833 --> 01:53:06,958
-Sit down. Welcome.
-Thank you.

1790
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:09,041
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1791
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:10,666
You didn't go to church?

1792
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:11,958
No, ma, I didn't.

1793
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:14,541
We have gone to Sunday mass
and we are back.

1794
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:17,541
The children have eaten.
Even I have eaten too.

1795
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:19,208
They're sleeping.

1796
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:22,166
But Papa Chidi went to watch FIFA final.

1797
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,708
Ooh. I have not been following.

1798
01:53:24,791 --> 01:53:27,125
Have you been following the matches?

1799
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:29,708
No. I don't have time.

1800
01:53:29,791 --> 01:53:32,875
Mm. Okay. Um…

1801
01:53:32,958 --> 01:53:34,750
Rose has traveled.

1802
01:53:34,833 --> 01:53:39,041
And I'm thinking of going
to my hometown next week.

1803
01:53:39,125 --> 01:53:40,875
Really? I hope all is well?

1804
01:53:40,958 --> 01:53:43,375
-Yes, all is well, Mama Chidi. Thank you.
-Okay.

1805
01:53:43,458 --> 01:53:47,375
So I wanted to ask you
to please help us watch our place,

1806
01:53:47,458 --> 01:53:48,916
'till I come back.

1807
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,500
I'm not going for long.

1808
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:51,666
-Really?
-Yes.

1809
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,291
-How long are you gone?
-Only one week.

1810
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:56,458
-Only one week. Okay.
-Just-- Yes.

1811
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:58,500
-Please when you go, rest. Mm?
-I will.

1812
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:00,000
-Safe journey.
-Thank you.

1813
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,583
-Please, rest well.
-I will.

1814
01:54:02,666 --> 01:54:05,166
Let me leave you to read your newspaper.

1815
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:06,708
No, it's just newspaper.

1816
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:08,583
But eh, my sister,

1817
01:54:08,666 --> 01:54:11,458
this drug thing
is becoming very serious.

1818
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:14,458
Everybody is carrying drugs,
wanting to be rich.

1819
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:15,791
Now, now, now, now.

1820
01:54:15,875 --> 01:54:19,541
They can't wait for God to bless them.
Because they want big, big money.

1821
01:54:19,625 --> 01:54:21,833
-Ah. Thank you very much, ma.
-Mm. Okay.

1822
01:54:21,916 --> 01:54:23,125
-Rest.
-Yes. Thank you.

1823
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:26,791
Don't overwork yourself
and forget to take care of yourself.

1824
01:54:27,625 --> 01:54:32,500
[announcer] Oh, what a moment
at the finals against the Germans.

1825
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:34,291
As you can see…

1826
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:45,083
Here they go again. Passing the ball.

1827
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:49,041
Yes, he moved it to Joseph Babatunde.

1828
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:51,416
Oh, my goodness.
Yes! Nearly! Going closer!

1829
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:55,291
He stands a chance. And, it's a goal!

1830
01:54:55,375 --> 01:54:57,708
[all cheering]

1831
01:54:57,791 --> 01:55:00,458
Beautiful one by the Golden Eaglets!

1832
01:55:00,541 --> 01:55:01,958
Oh, what a game!

1833
01:55:03,583 --> 01:55:05,458
[door creaks]

1834
01:55:13,083 --> 01:55:15,625
[chilling music playing]

1835
01:55:24,166 --> 01:55:26,125
[shushes]

1836
01:55:26,208 --> 01:55:29,291
-Be still. Still. Hey!
-[gasping]

1837
01:55:29,375 --> 01:55:32,750
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Be still, be still.

1838
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:35,875
[shushes]

1839
01:55:35,958 --> 01:55:37,208
Good.

1840
01:55:38,583 --> 01:55:41,500
Are you listening? Are you listening?

1841
01:55:43,416 --> 01:55:44,333
[gasps]

1842
01:55:44,416 --> 01:55:46,500
Your friend is dead.

1843
01:55:46,583 --> 01:55:49,833
Shh! Be still! I want you to disappear.

1844
01:55:49,916 --> 01:55:52,375
Go to wherever you like, I don't care.

1845
01:55:52,458 --> 01:55:55,583
Just get out of here before daybreak.

1846
01:55:55,666 --> 01:55:58,125
[crying] What happened to Rose?

1847
01:56:14,958 --> 01:56:16,416
Are you okay?

1848
01:56:20,333 --> 01:56:21,833
What's the problem?

1849
01:56:21,916 --> 01:56:25,125
[uneasy music playing]

1850
01:56:25,208 --> 01:56:27,166
Do you want me to call the hostess?

1851
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,625
[dramatic music playing]

1852
01:56:57,208 --> 01:56:59,208
Burst bags.

1853
01:56:59,291 --> 01:57:00,833
[sobs]

1854
01:57:00,916 --> 01:57:03,166
She was a bad investment.

1855
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,458
-Shh!
-She was someone's daugh--

1856
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:08,875
Don't even! Don't. Don't try it.

1857
01:57:08,958 --> 01:57:11,666
If you're looking for someone to blame,
blame yourself!

1858
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:13,833
You put too much doubt in her mind.

1859
01:57:13,916 --> 01:57:16,208
Damn! You caused everything you know!

1860
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:18,416
Hey! Shh. Shut up! Shut up.

1861
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:21,958
Get out of this place by daybreak.

1862
01:57:22,041 --> 01:57:25,708
If I come back and meet you here,
you're dead meat.

1863
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,625
Dead meat!

1864
01:57:30,208 --> 01:57:32,250
[sobs]

1865
01:57:32,333 --> 01:57:35,291
[dramatic music playing]

1866
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,500
[sobbing]

1867
01:57:38,583 --> 01:57:41,541
Rose. [sobs]

1868
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:51,291
And I warned you, Rose.

1869
01:57:54,291 --> 01:57:58,208
I warned you.

1870
01:58:04,166 --> 01:58:06,625
It took death for you to open up, Tolani.

1871
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:09,666
Eh? All by yourself.

1872
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,041
Facing all these difficulties.

1873
01:58:12,125 --> 01:58:15,250
You should've come home. Hmm?

1874
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:20,291
Are you scared of your home?
Do you have another mother?

1875
01:58:20,375 --> 01:58:22,708
[sniffles] Mommy…

1876
01:58:24,041 --> 01:58:28,125
You've taught me, and you made sure
I can stand on my own.

1877
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:30,083
Not in this kind of situation.

1878
01:58:30,166 --> 01:58:33,541
Not when you're suffering,
not when you're hungry.

1879
01:58:33,625 --> 01:58:36,750
Look, right now,
I'll boil some herbs for you.

1880
01:58:36,833 --> 01:58:38,833
For you bathe with and drink. Yes.

1881
01:58:39,458 --> 01:58:41,541
-Herbs?
-Yes, herbs.

1882
01:58:41,625 --> 01:58:45,000
Can you see all that hollowness
in your neck? It will fill up.

1883
01:58:45,083 --> 01:58:49,875
Let me quickly go make it.
Go in and change.

1884
01:58:49,958 --> 01:58:51,041
I hear you.

1885
01:58:51,125 --> 01:58:52,958
May I never be unfortunate.

1886
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:02,625
-Good morning, ma.
-My dear.

1887
01:59:02,708 --> 01:59:03,666
Happy selling.

1888
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:04,958
May you make sales.

1889
01:59:05,041 --> 01:59:06,791
-You too.
-Thanks!

1890
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,708
-Good morning, ma.
-Good morning.

1891
01:59:14,416 --> 01:59:15,750
Tolani!

1892
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:18,875
-Tolani.
-Ma?

1893
01:59:18,958 --> 01:59:20,291
You have a visitor.

1894
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:22,416
Who is it?

1895
01:59:29,791 --> 01:59:31,166
Sanwo.

1896
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:33,583
How'd you know I was here?

1897
01:59:34,166 --> 01:59:35,375
I'm going to the market.

1898
01:59:36,875 --> 01:59:38,666
When I get back,
we'll finish our talk.

1899
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:39,625
Yes, ma.

1900
01:59:40,625 --> 01:59:41,958
-Bye, ma.
-Bye, ma.

1901
01:59:42,041 --> 01:59:43,000
Bye, my dear.

1902
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:49,375
Have a seat.

1903
01:59:52,041 --> 01:59:53,875
You're surprised to see me, right?

1904
01:59:55,125 --> 01:59:56,625
Will you drink some water?

1905
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,500
I will.

1906
02:00:18,541 --> 02:00:20,291
-Here.
-Thank you.

1907
02:00:34,375 --> 02:00:35,458
Help me give thanks.

1908
02:00:36,458 --> 02:00:37,333
For what?

1909
02:00:38,125 --> 02:00:39,333
I found a job.

1910
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:41,875
Where?

1911
02:00:42,625 --> 02:00:44,041
Consultancy firm.

1912
02:00:45,083 --> 02:00:46,625
What would you be doing there?

1913
02:00:47,416 --> 02:00:49,750
I'm in the accounting department.

1914
02:00:50,833 --> 02:00:52,583
At least you'll be able to move out.

1915
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,250
Tolani, what happened?

1916
02:01:00,333 --> 02:01:01,541
I called your office,

1917
02:01:02,916 --> 02:01:06,000
Godwin said Salako sacked you
for misconduct.

1918
02:01:06,083 --> 02:01:07,916
When I pressed him further,

1919
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,833
he said Mrs. Archibong
queried Salako and suspended him.

1920
02:01:11,916 --> 02:01:14,500
That suspension is how he'll lose his job.

1921
02:01:14,583 --> 02:01:17,625
May God let her read
what I wrote in my report.

1922
02:01:17,708 --> 02:01:20,541
She'll see that Rose and I were not crazy.

1923
02:01:22,208 --> 02:01:25,750
He doesn't know who he's dealing with.
He doesn't know your spirit.

1924
02:01:28,291 --> 02:01:29,833
What are you going to do now?

1925
02:01:31,375 --> 02:01:34,458
I don't know yet. I don't know.

1926
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:37,500
[Tolani sighs]

1927
02:01:48,791 --> 02:01:50,416
This is the money you loaned me.

1928
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:52,666
Take it.

1929
02:01:56,833 --> 02:01:59,166
And I'll give you more
before the end of the month.

1930
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:01,583
For the suffering you went through.

1931
02:02:02,375 --> 02:02:03,708
This is enough.

1932
02:02:04,875 --> 02:02:06,458
You tried.

1933
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,166
It's not up to you to decide.

1934
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:11,833
Thank you.

1935
02:02:14,541 --> 02:02:17,833
[Tolani] You did everything you could
to try and drive me away.

1936
02:02:18,833 --> 02:02:22,250
-It's not like that.
-It's not like that? How is it then?

1937
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:25,208
Can you not remember
all the rubbish you did?

1938
02:02:25,958 --> 02:02:28,541
-You're the one who did rubbish.
-Me, doing rubbish?

1939
02:02:30,166 --> 02:02:31,333
Stop lying.

1940
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:34,583
-Tolani.
-Mm?

1941
02:02:34,666 --> 02:02:37,708
You know only rich people
get married before they're 40.

1942
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:38,708
Mmm!

1943
02:02:38,791 --> 02:02:41,583
I'm not important?
Money is more important than me.

1944
02:02:41,666 --> 02:02:42,583
Don't say that.

1945
02:02:42,666 --> 02:02:47,416
After all the trouble you caused me.
You think I'll let you go that easily?

1946
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:51,125
[upbeat music playing]

1947
02:02:51,208 --> 02:02:53,041
[chuckles]

1948
02:03:01,083 --> 02:03:04,833
That reminds me.
I forgot to ask you, where's Rose?

1949
02:03:04,916 --> 02:03:06,125
Good afternoon.

1950
02:03:07,541 --> 02:03:08,791
Rose.

1951
02:03:09,875 --> 02:03:12,083
Mama Chidi said she wasn't home.

1952
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:13,791
Rose has gone home.

1953
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:18,791
That's good. We all need rest.

1954
02:03:41,291 --> 02:03:42,916
That reminds me, Sanwo, please,

1955
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,583
help me give my landlord this one
and give Violet this one.

1956
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:48,625
And you know my furniture?

1957
02:03:48,708 --> 02:03:51,458
I want you to send it to me
when you get to Lagos.

1958
02:03:51,541 --> 02:03:54,500
Or maybe you should help me sell them
and send the money.

1959
02:03:54,583 --> 02:03:56,625
Tolani. Say it one at a time.

1960
02:03:56,708 --> 02:04:00,416
All right, don't be upset.
I'll write it all down.

1961
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:03,416
But can I trust you to follow through?

1962
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:09,250
-I've told you before, I'm not a bastard.
-Alright, I've hear you. Don't be angry.

1963
02:04:10,833 --> 02:04:14,208
[upbeat music playing]

1964
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:27,250
-Sorry.
-[driver] No worries, sir.
