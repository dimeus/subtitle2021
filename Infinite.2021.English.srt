1
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:56,138
There are among us a people,

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,184
gifted with a perfect memory
of all their past lives.

3
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:03,187
They call themselves... lnfl'nites.

4
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:09,944
Among the lnflm'tes,
two groups have vied for power.

5
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,404
On one side the believers,

6
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,073
dedicated to using their kno w/edge

7
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:17,326
for the protection and growth
of all humanity.

8
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,828
Against them stand the n/hi/ists,

9
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:22,206
who see this power as a curse.

10
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,584
New technologies have given the nihilists

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,587
an opportunity to end all life on earth.

12
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,299
And the race is on for its control.

13
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:06,750
Treadwa y, tell me you got it.

14
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,837
Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I got it.

15
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,974
Might be delayed a little.

16
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:24,018
- I'm headed to meet you now.
- Copy that.

17
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:46,999
Treadwa y, you okay?

18
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,751
We can't let him get the egg back.

19
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,881
I can't believe
bathurst would go this far.

20
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,124
He's not the man we remember.

21
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,051
Shit.

22
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,400
Shit.

23
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,135
Abel, I'm gonna take a shortcut.
Meet me at the freeway.

24
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,735
They got it blocked off.

25
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,197
- Get to the base of the crane.
- Treadway, listen.

26
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,656
Do not go up that bridge.

27
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,792
Treadway? Treadway?

28
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,672
Abel, listen to me.

29
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:44,092
If I fail, look inside.

30
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,404
I don't know what miracle
you think you're gonna pull off,

31
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,056
but there's a 150-foot gap
in front of you.

32
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,807
What is his plan?

33
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,618
Leona. Please.

34
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:56,832
Leona, wake up. Wake up.

35
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,614
I'll find you in the beginning.

36
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:30,657
I love you.

37
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:55,557
Did you ever have a dream so real...
It felt like a memory?

38
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,312
You ever catch yourself in the mirror
and it's a surprise?

39
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:04,066
Like you expected to see
someone else's face

40
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,442
staring back at you.

41
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,700
All these people all going some where,
all doing something.

42
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,869
But what does it all add up to?

43
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:17,954
Maybe if I knew the answer,

44
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,165
all the little things
might click together.

45
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:21,792
They might make sense.

46
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,920
- Hey. Hi.
- E Van. Right on time.

47
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:26,963
Nice to see you. How are ya?

48
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:29,424
- Any trouble getting here?
- No. No, not at all.

49
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:32,803
Third interview this week.

50
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,596
- Here he is.
- Hey, gentlemen.

51
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,014
Hey. How are you?

52
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,266
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Evan, great to meet you.

53
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,869
Thank you for your time.
I really appreciate it.

54
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:41,603
- Right.
- Wow.

55
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,939
Beautiful place you have here.
Absolutely gorgeous.

56
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,483
I just got a couple questions
if you don't mind.

57
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:47,901
Of course.

58
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:52,906
There are a couple of question marks
in your past.

59
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,658
I recognize that.

60
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:58,578
You're the first face people see

61
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:01,081
when they walk into my restaurant.

62
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:02,582
And they'd be greeted with a smile.

63
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,210
I have had some issues in the past.

64
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:07,546
I did a full background check
on you, Mr. Mccauley.

65
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,674
I spoke to some of your past employers.

66
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,053
And you know what?
They all said the same thing.

67
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm interested to hear
what they had to say.

68
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:22,144
They say you're great!
They say you're smart. He's a smart guy.

69
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,104
Smart guy right here, huh?

70
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,440
That's all good.
I guess I've got the job then.

71
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,983
When do I start?

72
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:31,361
Tell me about the customer you attacked.

73
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,530
He assaulted a waitress.

74
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:34,948
So you broke his arm.

75
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,325
I did. It was unintentional.

76
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,579
Excuse me, but he grabbed her ass.

77
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:44,291
I asked him to leave politely.
He put his hands on me.

78
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:46,668
No charges were ever filed.
Everything was dismissed.

79
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,880
So you just walked out
of a shift at locanda

80
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,799
and you never came back?

81
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,010
I had a personal issue.
That was six years ago.

82
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:58,722
Yeah, your manager told me
that you were institutionalized.

83
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:02,418
- For two weeks.
- Two weeks. Melanie, it's just two weeks.

84
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,810
Just two weeks.

85
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:08,064
Look. My struggles with mental illness
are a part of my past.

86
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,942
I haven't had so much
as an eye twitch since.

87
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,027
I think, if anything,

88
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,988
getting through what I've been through
only makes me stronger.

89
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:19,326
And I am 100% confident
in my ability to manage here.

90
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,745
Thanks for coming in today, Evan.

91
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,289
Please. Look, I know what it looks like.

92
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:27,125
But my illness isn't an issue
you have to worry about.

93
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,462
- I promise you...
- Hey, we'll be in touch, okay?

94
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,802
No, you won't.

95
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:38,553
Excuse me?

96
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,473
Look, I know the brush-off when I hear it.

97
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:46,728
Mr. Mccauley, you are clearly awesome
at dealing with conflict.

98
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,146
You have no idea.

99
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,899
Thanks for coming in. But you're right.

100
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,527
I don't think I will need
to be calling you.

101
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:57,364
You think you know my story
because you ran a background check

102
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,865
and made a couple of phone calls?

103
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,953
I knew yours when I shook
your well-moisturized hand.

104
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,330
Thank you for your time.

105
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,208
I get it. Ldo.

106
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,252
Who's going to hire
a diagnosed schizophrenic

107
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:11,503
with a history of violence,

108
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:15,131
when there's a dozen candidates out there
with spark/mg clean records?

109
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:18,301
But what's really on my mind
is if / can't get a job,

110
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,719
I can't pay rent this month.

111
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,349
I mean, dry-cleaning this suit
wasn't exactly free.

112
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,689
And more than that, I've gotta get
something together real quick,

113
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,941
because these meds, the y're running out.

114
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,193
And once they do, shit gets real.

115
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,633
Are there things you just know how to do?

116
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,804
Like, no one's ever showed you.

117
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:07,225
Somehow each step
in the process makes sense.

118
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,577
Like you're remembering it.

119
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:28,079
Not learning it.

120
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,308
For reals, you really
made that shit yourself, man?

121
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,560
- Yep.
- Damn.

122
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,355
Hey, yo, Ronny. Yo, Ronny.

123
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,732
- Evan, man.
- Hey.

124
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:01,112
As requested.
Kimotsuki-styled iron. Handcrafted.

125
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,364
One of a kind.

126
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,450
Oh, hell, yeah.

127
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,038
Hattori hanzo, yo.

128
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:13,416
- Damn. Nice.
- Goddamn.

129
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,793
Get off me.

130
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:17,212
Now, let's get this man paid.

131
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:19,547
You get high off this shit?

132
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,841
No. Clozapine. It's an antipsychotic.

133
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:24,094
You get paid in pills?

134
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,720
Evan here's on "Ronny-care."

135
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,390
Yeah. Dr. Ronny.

136
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:31,059
Why don't you, like,
get them at Duane reade?

137
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,645
'Cause Evan don't wanna talk
to shrinks every two weeks, right?

138
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:36,272
Yeah. Evan can't afford
400 bucks a month on a scrip.

139
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,983
Yo, Wikipedia.

140
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:42,404
- What's the capital of brakina fatso?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,239
It's pronounced Burkina Faso.

142
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,116
Ouagadougou.
Could I have my pills, please?

143
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:50,745
Shit, man. Forgot my count, man.

144
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,288
You made that up.

145
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,292
Damn, man!

146
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,841
Nah. Homeboy knows everything. He a freak.

147
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:05,218
How do you know so much?

148
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,803
Honestly, I wish I knew.

149
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,138
Makes me nuts.

150
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:10,473
Could I have my pills, please?

151
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:18,273
Dang, girl. You eyeballing my boy
like he a steak dinner.

152
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:23,194
Yo, yo. What's gunpowder made of?

153
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,823
74% potassium nitrate, 13% charcoal.

154
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,034
- Okay.
- Damn.

155
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,118
Impressive, man.

156
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:34,956
I said eyes on me.

157
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,792
Come on, Ronny.

158
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,754
There you go, man. Sixty packages.

159
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,172
That's only 55.

160
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:44,090
For real?

161
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:46,634
Close enough.

162
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,887
The hell it is. I live on those.

163
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:53,099
Sixty. Hey. Hey.

164
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,061
You wanted the real thing, right?
That is it.

165
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,897
That is folded over 70 times.
Carbon-treated steel.

166
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,899
Take your damn hands off me.

167
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:03,485
You better tell your boy
to learn how to count.

168
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,153
The deal was for 60 bags.

169
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,614
Yeah? Well, that's all we got.

170
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:10,533
You don't like it,
you can go back to bellevue.

171
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,954
Get the get on homeboy.

172
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,208
I wanna test this shit out.

173
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:25,757
Yo, what's gunpowder made of?

174
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,841
Hold out your arm.

175
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,176
Showtime.

176
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,430
Hold out your arm.

177
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:37,018
Get up.

178
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,522
Put your arm there.
Now, it's your neck or arm, baby.

179
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,023
You choose.

180
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:45,318
Ronny, that's not a toy, bro.

181
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,861
Mind your business, Evan.

182
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,613
Come on, Ronny. This ain't funny.

183
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,040
Oh, god! My fingers!

184
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,002
I think it works, huh, Ronny?

185
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,797
- Cut my goddamn fingers off, man!
- You'll be all right.

186
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,092
Hey, sweetheart,
why don't you head on home now?

187
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:10,927
You're tripping, bro.

188
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,138
You are done, homey. You're a dead fool.

189
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,681
I don't know, Ronny.

190
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:17,934
You're talking to a guy who buys
antipsychotic medication from you.

191
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:21,104
I'm feeling a little unbalanced right now.

192
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:24,190
Maybe the best way to get
the voices in my head to stop talking

193
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,650
is to cut yours off.

194
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,068
Do you think it would help?

195
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:31,698
No. Don't fire. Don't shoot. It's cool.

196
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,533
We're cool, man. We're cool. All right?

197
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:37,162
Hey, dickhead. Grab my pills. Now.

198
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,663
There you go.

199
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:41,082
- You're crazy, man.
- If I was crazy,

200
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,418
I'd have chopped you up
in little pieces a long time ago.

201
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,752
Give me my pills.

202
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,424
And you listen to me, Ronny.
I'm not crazy, okay?

203
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,843
I'm just misunderstood. All right?

204
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:47,232
- Help!
- Leona!

205
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:26,271
NYPD picked up an Evan mccauley.
Drug deal gone south.

206
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:29,440
Cops found a sword on him.

207
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,527
Blade was made with a process

208
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,863
hasn't been used since edo Japan.

209
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,118
He claims he forged it himself.

210
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,787
Another broker-turned-h/pster blacksmith.

211
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,165
Oh, ye of little faith.
Are you seeing this, Nora?

212
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,335
- Treadwa y?
- Precisely.

213
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:53,631
If we know, bathurst knows.

214
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,882
Be careful.

215
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,093
Thanks, ll/lom.

216
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:21,367
Tell us when you're done, sir.

217
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,785
Can I get my phone call?

218
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,080
Supposed to get a phone call.

219
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,681
You're dressed way too nice
to be an NYPD detective, so...

220
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,434
Must be a doctor.

221
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,021
Not a thing?

222
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,316
No recognition at all?

223
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:57,695
I think I should feel hurt.

224
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,660
Do you remember... Syracuse?

225
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,287
Syracuse.

226
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,538
The siege.

227
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,625
Second punic war.

228
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,878
Where we first met.

229
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:17,215
Well, not quite the thrill ride
of the first punic war,

230
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,591
but sequels are tough, huh?

231
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,302
You disappoint me.

232
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,429
Well, join the club.

233
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,597
I notice...

234
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:28,017
You didn't sign it.

235
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,022
Then again...

236
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:36,943
Craftsmanship like this...

237
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,364
You didn't need to... did you?

238
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:44,200
I made a sword. Is that a crime?

239
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:47,995
Evan mccauley.

240
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:52,083
Diagnosed with schizophrenia at 14...

241
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,045
After carving the words "look inside"

242
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,257
into your chest with a box cutter.

243
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:02,802
Electroshock proved unhelpful.

244
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:04,595
But these...

245
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:07,598
Are not bad, eh?

246
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,897
- Doctor, can I...
- Please. Go ahead.

247
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:22,530
At 16, attempted suicide via car crash,

248
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:26,159
necessitating the steel plate
in your skull.

249
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,829
Spent the rest of your early life
bouncing around

250
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:33,332
between psych hospitals and foster homes.

251
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,460
Well, I only cut
a couple of his fingers off.

252
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:38,546
I don't think I'm gonna need to plead
insanity on this one, am I, doctor?

253
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:39,797
I'm curious.

254
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:42,508
"Look inside."

255
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,554
- Why those words?
- Why not?

256
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:16,250
Which one of these... is yours?

257
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:20,171
You can skip the...
Whatever the hell this is

258
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:21,964
because none of that is mine.

259
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,179
You're not supposed to have that in here.

260
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,189
What's going on here?

261
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:40,191
Hey, officer.

262
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,878
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

263
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:08,636
Pick it up.

264
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,471
What?

265
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:12,765
Pick it up.

266
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:19,981
Paris.

267
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,732
1794.

268
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,860
The last meal of the comte d'anjou.

269
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:30,825
A Bordeaux.

270
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,619
Not a bad choice for a last meal.

271
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:36,330
Was it yours?

272
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:41,353
I wish I knew what you were talking about,
but I don't know what to tell...

273
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:42,628
Jesus!

274
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,964
Every time you say, "I don't know,"

275
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:48,092
this trigger gets pulled.

276
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,682
- Is it yours?
- I don't know...

277
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,309
Are you out of your mind?

278
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,872
- We're in a police station! Officer!
- The room is soundproof!

279
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,438
They won't even hear it when I put

280
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:04,275
250 grams of lead
through the back of your skull.

281
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:12,533
- Is it yours?
- Yes.

282
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,410
Okay, yes, it's mine. Are you happy?

283
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:15,494
Jesus!

284
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,416
Lying... won't help.

285
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:23,252
Look, I'm just a guy
who was at the wrong place

286
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,379
at the wrong time. That's all.

287
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,756
Last chance, Evan.

288
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:32,053
Is... it... yours?

289
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:14,387
There's the treadway I know!

290
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:26,107
Little trick I learned from you.

291
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,195
Hello, old friend.

292
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:54,844
Vvhoa!

293
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,932
Get in!

294
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,697
- Hold on.
- Shit!

295
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:35,885
Go! Turn! Turn!

296
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:49,648
Oh, shit!

297
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:54,195
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

298
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:56,863
Go! Go!

299
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,912
Inside!

300
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,499
- Hold tight.
- Oh, sh...

301
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:17,843
Cover!

302
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:21,806
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

303
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,391
- Go the other way!
- Take the wheel.

304
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,060
- What?
- Get out of the car!

305
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:29,146
Yeah, sure. Retractable steering wheel.
No problem. That's perfectly normal.

306
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:34,401
- Reverse.
- Shoot that son of a bitch.

307
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:42,868
Move! Clear the street!

308
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:44,703
Shoot the driver!

309
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,876
Jesus Christ!

310
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,257
Who are they?

311
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,388
Relax, it's bulletproof.

312
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:07,518
180 now!

313
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:25,827
Don't stop.

314
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,333
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

315
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,626
Who the hell are you?

316
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,169
I'm Nora brightman.

317
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,755
Okay. But who was that dude back there?

318
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:20,090
Bathurst. You didn't recognize him?

319
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:22,301
No, I didn't. But clearly you did.

320
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:24,094
Well, you've known him a long time.

321
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:27,431
I've never seen that man in my life.
Him, I think I'd remember.

322
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:29,516
Well, not in this life, maybe.

323
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,727
Maybe I bumped into him
during the second punic war?

324
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,229
Or maybe it was the French revolution.
I'm bad with dates.

325
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:35,481
- You remember that?
- No.

326
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:37,316
I don't remember the French revolution.

327
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:39,902
I figured it out. I see now. I get it.

328
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:42,279
- You do?
- None of this is real.

329
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,115
It's a psychotic break.
I'm gonna wake up in a hospital somewhere,

330
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,368
drooling all over myself,
strung out on lithium.

331
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,011
Is that easier to believe than the idea

332
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,205
that maybe destiny
has something more in store for you?

333
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:54,667
Destiny? Where I come from,
we got bills to pay, rent to make.

334
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,294
- Nobody's got time for destiny.
- That's a shame.

335
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:15,562
I know you've been
looking for answers, Evan.

336
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:17,940
You're not crazy. You never have been.

337
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:20,943
No, I'm not crazy. I'm just delusional.

338
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:23,529
Do you ever find yourself
drawn to places you've never been?

339
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:26,332
Do you ever see a picture of a place
and just know you've been there?

340
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,741
Do you know things you shouldn't?

341
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:31,453
Do you pick things up fast,
almost as if you're remembering skills,

342
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:32,621
not learning them?

343
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,415
I've told a dozen therapists this.

344
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:37,126
I've been analyzed every way possible,
a hundred times over.

345
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:38,585
It doesn't mean anything.

346
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,796
Do you dream in other languages?

347
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,553
That's what schizophrenia is.
Different people, same head.

348
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:51,098
Well, what if it was the same person,
different lives?

349
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:53,434
- You're talking about reincarnation.
- Yeah.

350
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:57,021
You can forge a sword
because you were a blacksmith.

351
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:59,606
You speak Russian
because you were Russian.

352
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,400
Look, I hate to break it to you.

353
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:04,737
It's a comforting idea,
souls moving from one body to the next.

354
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,323
But it's basically a spiritual equivalent
of "better luck next time." Okay?

355
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:10,367
Nothing more and nothing less.

356
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,286
Feel safe and warm
inside all that cynicism?

357
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,514
- I do, actually.
- And how's that working out for you?

358
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,499
What, in the grand scheme of things?
Like big-picture shit? Not so great.

359
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,376
But I'm good. I'm surviving.

360
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:25,174
The visions you've had your entire life,
Evan, aren't hallucinations.

361
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:26,550
They're memories.

362
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:30,554
So, you're saying
that a hundred doctors were wrong?

363
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:31,889
Fifty medications didn't work

364
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:35,100
because I'm really
a reincarnated Russian blacksmith?

365
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:36,685
This is real.

366
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:40,105
I'm real.

367
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,525
Oh, yeah? Well, this is no version
of reincarnation I've ever heard of.

368
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:44,985
Buddhist, hindu, sikh.

369
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,154
They believe each life begins
with a clean slate.

370
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,491
The answers you've been
looking for all your life...

371
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,702
All you gotta do is get on that plane.

372
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,750
You know what I'm really
asking myself right now is?

373
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:03,879
What if the craziest thing I've heard...
And this is some crazy shit...

374
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:06,442
Is actually the first thing
that's ever made any goddamn sense?

375
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:13,305
I don't gotta go feed the cat, so...
Let's go.

376
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:41,917
Go on.

377
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:05,315
They left from a private airport.

378
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,651
It was an unlisted flight.

379
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:10,863
She was there fast.

380
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:13,490
Too fast.

381
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,578
The sword hadn't been in the system
for more than a few hours.

382
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:20,914
- Then they have a base here in New York.
- I want it found.

383
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,500
It will lead us to Evan mccauley.

384
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:25,711
He will lead us to the egg.

385
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:27,462
Again.

386
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:50,611
We call ourselves the infinite.

387
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,363
Less than 500 souls from across the globe,

388
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:57,618
all born with the ability
to remember all our past lives

389
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:59,461
and the skills we've learned
in each of them.

390
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:02,372
There are two groups within the infinites,

391
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:07,002
bathurst and the nihilists,
who just want the world to end,

392
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:09,421
and us... the believers.

393
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,965
And what is it that we believe?

394
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,093
We believe that our gift
is a responsibility.

395
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:19,973
That it's up to us to leave humanity
better off than we found it.

396
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:21,058
Yeah?

397
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,144
I think I'm gonna need these.

398
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:59,596
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,681
Thanks.

400
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:05,018
It's a long way from Arthur Avenue.

401
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:08,647
It always blows my mind.

402
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:11,817
We call it the hub.

403
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,547
This is the place where you're gonna get
your memories back, Evan.

404
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:23,495
We'll be landing soon.

405
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:42,472
- Recognize anything?
- I'm pretty sure I'd remember this.

406
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,767
It used to be dedicated
to scientific research.

407
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:48,186
Anthropology and linguistics.

408
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,439
All of us using what we've learned.

409
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:53,650
Life afterlife
for the advancement of mankind.

410
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,943
And what is it now?

411
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:58,488
Headquarters for the losing side
in the war.

412
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:05,871
Bathurst is the master of combat.

413
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:07,331
Hundreds of lifetimes.

414
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,050
You must be prepared for everything.

415
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,352
He's the apex predator in our world.

416
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:32,564
Again.

417
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:42,699
Why are they bowing?

418
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,786
They're hoping you're Heinrich treadway.

419
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:47,829
- Again!
- Reincarnated.

420
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:48,914
Heinrich?

421
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,917
It was a popular name in the '50s.

422
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,460
In the '505.

423
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:56,797
Great for rock 'n' roll,
but lousy for names, I guess.

424
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,174
The 17503.

425
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:04,179
What do I know that you need so bad?

426
00:37:04,971 --> 00:37:07,599
That's why you're here, to find out.

427
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,251
- This is treadway's room.
- Are you asking me or telling me?

428
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:38,672
I must've really screwed up
on my last incarnation.

429
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:39,756
Why would you say that?

430
00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:42,843
Have you seen where I live in this life?

431
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,768
That's treadway's himalaya diary.

432
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,315
That was me.

433
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,985
When I was Leona warrick.

434
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,822
And that was treadway.

435
00:38:11,663 --> 00:38:13,665
Two days after that picture was taken,

436
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,250
treadway saved my life.

437
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:19,421
There's a reason you picked that book.

438
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,090
All this tells me is what he did.

439
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:24,968
None of it tells me who he was.

440
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,888
Here we can study anything and everything.

441
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:31,099
Space, time, scale. It's all relevant.

442
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:34,311
That doesn't seem like much.

443
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:36,521
Welcome to my virtual sandbox.

444
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,857
- Name's garrick.
- Hi.

445
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,984
Garrick is our head
of technology and research.

446
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,777
He doesn't look like much.

447
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:45,906
Goddamn, it's good to see you again.

448
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,617
It's nice to meet you, too.

449
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,411
Don't worry.
All this shit, it just gets weirder.

450
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:53,497
Okay.

451
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,831
Now let's get started.

452
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,916
Follow me.

453
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:00,795
Stand there for me, please.

454
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:02,839
Okay.

455
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,500
That's the guy from the police station.

456
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:25,153
Bathurst.
He and treadway were once friends.

457
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:28,698
A dozen lifetimes. Wars, peace.
They stood together

458
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:31,076
at some of the greatest moments
in human history.

459
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,162
Then bathurst lost faith.

460
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:38,250
For the last 300 years,
he's been looking for a way out.

461
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,877
He needed a way to stop reincarnating.

462
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,712
He wants it all to end.

463
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:45,173
That's why he made this.

464
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:16,538
The egg.

465
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,791
Designed to kill
every living thing on earth.

466
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,294
That seems a little drastic.

467
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:25,380
If there is nothing left alr've,

468
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:27,966
there's noth/ng left to reincarnate r'nto.

469
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:34,014
It attacks life at the source, DNA...

470
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:37,642
Unwinding the very fabric of existence.

471
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,396
Every plant, e very animal, e very person.

472
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,689
Mama!

473
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:43,940
Jordan!

474
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:48,820
I'm coming!

475
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:59,289
Like unplugging a computer
when a program freezes.

476
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:00,957
Only when he pulls this plug,

477
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,251
seven billion people will go with him.

478
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:07,547
Everything it kills
accelerates the process.

479
00:41:12,218 --> 00:41:15,930
God! Holy shit, that felt freaking real!

480
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,892
Without you, none of us
would be here right now.

481
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:20,310
What are you talking about?

482
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:23,146
Last cycle, you raided bathurst's lab,

483
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:25,023
stole the egg, killed his Einstein

484
00:41:25,106 --> 00:41:26,483
and everyone who helped build it,

485
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,568
leaving him with no way to recreate it.

486
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,988
You took the secret
of the egg's whereabouts to your grave.

487
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,116
Bathurst spent this entire lifetime
looking for it.

488
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,203
And he's getting closer and closer
to finding it every day.

489
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,705
That's why he tracked you down
in New York.

490
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,040
So I get on the plane,

491
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:44,834
you get all my memories back
and I save the whole world. That's it?

492
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:46,795
That's pretty much basically it, right?

493
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,672
Told you it was gonna get weird.

494
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,006
So, what now?

495
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,428
Tell me good news, Nora.

496
00:41:55,512 --> 00:42:00,058
Bryan Porter.
Treadwa y had a gift with steel, didn't he?

497
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,434
Impeccable.

498
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:04,688
Your friends in the n ypd
were certainly impressed with it.

499
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:08,608
Unfortunately, their encryption skills
are less than impeccable.

500
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:10,819
Led us right to you.

501
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:24,791
You do know we have easier ways
of doing things now, right?

502
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:26,793
Newer...

503
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:30,338
Almost never means better.

504
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:42,976
We're going to uncover
Evan mccauley's location.

505
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,145
We'll brute-force your encryption.

506
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:50,108
But I'd consider it... a courtesy...

507
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:52,110
If you just...

508
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,280
Sped the process up.

509
00:42:58,992 --> 00:42:59,993
Tell us where he is.

510
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:10,670
Okay.

511
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:13,423
I know where he is.

512
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:17,218
Of course I do.

513
00:43:18,553 --> 00:43:21,806
I know exactly where he is. I just...

514
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:26,936
I, um...

515
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,734
I sometimes have difficulties...
With my memory.

516
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:33,818
Memory.

517
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:39,741
I remember when you used to gather honey
on the fields of marathon.

518
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:46,247
Just another reminder
of how nothing stays the same.

519
00:43:56,466 --> 00:43:57,801
Would you care for some?

520
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,475
You know what real torture is?

521
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:07,018
Listening to you?

522
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:14,192
Real torture... isn't physical pain...
But human stupidity.

523
00:44:14,984 --> 00:44:18,905
Being surrounded by it, engulfed in it.

524
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:21,366
Lifetime after lifetime.

525
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:25,203
People with their idiot grins!

526
00:44:25,286 --> 00:44:27,956
Their infuriating pleasantries!

527
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,958
Their need for approval!

528
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:33,753
Their unctuous attempts
to be loved and validated!

529
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,465
They are walking, talking obituaries

530
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:40,677
on the back page of a dying newspaper,

531
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,430
at the bottom of a birdcage,
in the corner of a filthy living room

532
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:45,974
of a hoarder cat lady!

533
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:48,685
- And we are forced...
- You'll never understand...

534
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:51,855
- To live amongst them over and over...
- Friendship, love...

535
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:53,815
- Endlessly.
- Trust.

536
00:44:53,898 --> 00:44:57,485
- That is the true definition of torture.
- You still don't understand about faith!

537
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:01,114
Faith! Blah, blah, blah!

538
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:02,407
Faith!

539
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:04,325
Faith.

540
00:45:06,244 --> 00:45:08,037
I'm tired of faith.

541
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,375
God must show me his face.

542
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,225
But thank you... for enlightening me.

543
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,162
You kept his fucking body?

544
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:50,830
Sexy son of a bitch, isn't he?

545
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,582
No. He's a dead guy floating in water.

546
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:54,500
That's pretty much my worst nightmare.

547
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,670
Actually, it's a crotonic acid matrix.
Keeps the cells alive.

548
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,881
Oh. That makes it
that much better. Thank you.

549
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:02,842
We're trying to understand
the science behind what we are.

550
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:11,684
Treadway believed that humans

551
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,646
are capable of so much more
than we realized.

552
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:17,329
Is this what you're telling me?
I'm not living up to my potential?

553
00:46:17,398 --> 00:46:19,484
I've heard that speech before.

554
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:21,235
Treadway pushed past boundaries

555
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,863
others might call paranormal, superhuman.

556
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,866
He can manipulate the energy
of the world around him.

557
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,409
I don't even know what that means.

558
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:30,370
What it means is you'll have skills

559
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:32,956
beyond anything you've ever imagined.

560
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,584
Those abilities are very deep.
Below the conscious level.

561
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:40,046
I'm down. How do we get them back?

562
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,259
Here, we retrain your memory.

563
00:46:45,343 --> 00:46:48,763
We combine the physical and the mental
to develop new neural path ways.

564
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:59,273
Il/lemor/es are held in every organ...

565
00:47:00,608 --> 00:47:02,026
Every cell in your body.

566
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:14,247
Regression takes the kind of concentration
it takes years to develop.

567
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:16,207
This is a shortcut.

568
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,670
We shock your mind
into syncing with the system.

569
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:53,828
It's working.

570
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:57,373
I'm seeing increased activity
in all his memory centers.

571
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,801
Come on.

572
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:54,722
- That's not treadway.
- Really?

573
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,307
He just beat you.

574
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,351
Treadway would've killed me.

575
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:06,692
Wow.

576
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:09,487
She wasn't kidding
about being at war, huh?

577
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:12,031
Improving the human condition.

578
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,285
Sometimes you do it
by painting a chapel ceiling...

579
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:18,621
Yeah. And sometimes
you drop them from a mile out.

580
00:49:18,704 --> 00:49:20,623
Don't touch that.

581
00:49:20,706 --> 00:49:22,208
Okay, okay.

582
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:28,464
That's no gun I've ever seen before.

583
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:32,051
We're reverse-engineering
bathurst's dethroner.

584
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:36,305
A dethroner? I mean, dude,
who's coming up with these names?

585
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:37,390
Look_.

586
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,144
You can't kill an infinite.
You kill the body, but...

587
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:43,980
- They get reincarnated.
- Yeah.

588
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:48,693
This implants in your head

589
00:49:48,776 --> 00:49:51,237
and pulls out your consciousness,

590
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:55,449
your soul, and onto a digital chip.

591
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,910
Your soul gets stuck on a disk
and breaks the cycle.

592
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:05,001
Over 200 of our brothers and sisters
are lost in that digital purgatory.

593
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:08,546
You come face to face with this,

594
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:12,508
my advice... find a way
to die the old-fashioned way.

595
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:18,264
Come in.

596
00:50:22,393 --> 00:50:24,061
Okay if I look around?

597
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:25,813
Be my guest.

598
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:47,335
These are all you, aren't they?

599
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,296
They're people I once was.

600
00:50:52,006 --> 00:50:53,007
All of them.

601
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:59,680
Wow. That's cool. You look happy.

602
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:02,433
I was.

603
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:05,228
Who's that guy?

604
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:08,356
In that picture, he was Abel.

605
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:13,736
Before then, other names... other faces.

606
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,321
But the soul...

607
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:18,282
The soul was always him.

608
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:21,619
So, what? You loved each other
through multiple lives?

609
00:51:22,703 --> 00:51:24,163
These are all the same place.

610
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:28,000
Angkor wat. What we call the beginning.

611
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:32,296
I'll find you in the beginning.

612
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,548
I love you.

613
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:37,551
When each of us
would find ourselves in a new life,

614
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:40,012
this is where Abel and I would go.

615
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,390
You're reincarnated.
How would you know where to go?

616
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:46,811
Most of us have a reawakening
that begins young.

617
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,273
Starts with small things, memories,

618
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:52,233
feelings about a place, dreams.

619
00:51:53,192 --> 00:51:56,946
By puberty...
Most infinites have full recall.

620
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:00,908
Right around the time
they diagnosed me schizophrenic.

621
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:04,537
So what happened
if you died young and got separated?

622
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,122
For an infinite...

623
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:11,836
Death isn't the end, it's like...
Turning the page in a book.

624
00:52:12,753 --> 00:52:15,339
Next chapter, same story.

625
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:17,383
That's crazy.

626
00:52:18,175 --> 00:52:21,178
New lives, new bodies,
always meeting back at the same place.

627
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:25,182
He was dethroned.

628
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,854
He's trapped on a computer somewhere.

629
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,900
My last life, I got my memories back...

630
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:38,237
And realized he was gone.

631
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,748
It's not my memories that matter, Evan.

632
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:51,667
It's yours.

633
00:52:58,591 --> 00:53:01,177
Your last life, in Mexico,

634
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:04,221
where did you hide the egg?

635
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,953
Where's the egg?

636
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,423
Where is it?

637
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:50,258
- He's spiking.
- Shut it down.

638
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:58,067
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.
Hey. Hey, just breathe.

639
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,568
- I need to get up.
- Breathe.

640
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:01,237
Kovic, check his vitals.

641
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,364
What happened in there, Evan?
What did you see?

642
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:06,242
Your neural network fired off
like the fourth of July.

643
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,471
I've been seeing this stuff all my life.
It still doesn't make any sense.

644
00:54:09,495 --> 00:54:10,913
Why can't he remember anything?

645
00:54:10,996 --> 00:54:12,676
Between the car accident, the electroshock

646
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:15,835
and the steel plate in his head,
his mind is fractured.

647
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:18,087
Something in there
won't let the memories flow.

648
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:22,633
I can't get them out.
I'm afraid the artisan is our last hope.

649
00:54:29,306 --> 00:54:31,392
He'll achieve recall soon.

650
00:54:33,477 --> 00:54:34,937
If he hasn't already.

651
00:54:43,654 --> 00:54:48,742
Hundreds of lifetimes,
and it all comes down to these few hours.

652
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,122
If we don't find him...

653
00:54:55,332 --> 00:54:57,585
Before he gets his memories back,

654
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:00,296
we lose the egg...

655
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,174
Forever.

656
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:09,930
The wheels keep turning and we can never...

657
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:13,017
Escape.

658
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:19,690
We go at dawn.

659
00:56:12,618 --> 00:56:14,870
It's been a while, Otto.

660
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:19,667
No one's called me by that name in...
So many lifetimes.

661
00:56:28,884 --> 00:56:30,636
Hello, my love.

662
00:56:32,137 --> 00:56:33,138
What happened to you?

663
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,643
You were so beautiful.

664
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,062
As were you.

665
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:42,356
You don't miss it...

666
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:43,816
The agility...

667
00:56:45,025 --> 00:56:46,026
The vibrancy...

668
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:48,821
Being confined to this?

669
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:51,865
You see me as something broken. I don't.

670
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,661
You're the cripple, Otto.

671
00:56:55,744 --> 00:56:58,038
- Crippled by your cowardice.
- Cowardice?

672
00:56:58,122 --> 00:57:03,210
No. I'm crippled... by my memory.

673
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:07,214
You get your memories back
over years. Not me.

674
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:11,427
I get it all back as my brain forms.
In the womb.

675
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:16,765
Endless hours, days, weeks, months.

676
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:18,225
No room to move!

677
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:22,980
Nothing for my brain to do but eat itself.

678
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:26,775
All these lifetimes,
the magnitude of this gift,

679
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:29,194
and you haven't learned a thing.

680
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:30,738
I have to get out.

681
00:57:31,905 --> 00:57:33,449
I have to make it stop.

682
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:38,037
Don't do it. Don't give him anything.

683
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:40,748
Where is treadway?

684
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:49,214
We storming the beach at normandy?

685
00:57:49,882 --> 00:57:51,759
You never know with the artisan.

686
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,053
Let's get ready.

687
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:31,131
Color out, please.

688
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:36,887
So, the artisan's a gambler?

689
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,514
No, he's a hedonist.

690
00:58:38,597 --> 00:58:41,850
Infinite lives,
infinite opportunity for debauchery.

691
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:43,352
Sounds like my kinda guy.

692
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:39,742
Alexa, music off.

693
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:41,952
Get him cleaned up and outta here.

694
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:44,997
You're operating on dead guys now?

695
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,666
Da Vinci used to cut into human cadavers

696
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,794
so that he could better understand
the human form.

697
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,004
For me...

698
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:54,131
I'm all about that brain, baby.

699
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:58,469
But you know that all too well.

700
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:03,307
Oh, what a beautiful cranial arch
you got this time around.

701
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:07,603
I could better examine it
if I severed your head from your neck.

702
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:09,897
Like treadway did to me when last we met.

703
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,815
- Try it.
- Oh.

704
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,442
Bathurst took the hub.

705
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,072
- Does he have the egg?
- No.

706
01:00:19,656 --> 01:00:21,116
Think we'd be here if he did?

707
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:25,662
Wherever it is, it's still in his head.

708
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:28,957
Treadway?

709
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,709
So they say.

710
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:34,505
Wait. Is he blocked?

711
01:00:37,049 --> 01:00:39,718
Well, well, well, look at this.

712
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,803
Huh.

713
01:00:41,845 --> 01:00:45,432
So... your hard drive got fragged,

714
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,727
which means we're gonna
have to reset your memory.

715
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:53,524
And, Heinrich, I gotta tell ya,
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

716
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,319
Check this out.

717
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:03,492
You're all familiar with the idea
that when you die,

718
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,953
your life flashes before your eyes, right?

719
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,915
This machine enhances that experience,

720
01:01:09,998 --> 01:01:12,251
prolonging your sense of time,

721
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:17,631
allowing you to restore
or reorder everything inside.

722
01:01:17,714 --> 01:01:19,842
This... this right here

723
01:01:19,925 --> 01:01:24,137
is the closest you're gonna get
to a total mental reboot.

724
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:26,907
Are you planning on trying to drown me?

725
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,433
'Cause I got a thing about drowning.

726
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:30,727
- Which is?
- I don't like it!

727
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:33,647
What kind of success rate
is this guy working with anyway?

728
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,358
Confidence is... high.

729
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,443
Yeah, and so are you, obviously.

730
01:01:39,194 --> 01:01:41,029
Okay. Hey.

731
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:43,615
I like you this time around.
You're actually funny.

732
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:47,870
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're usually kind of a jerk.

733
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:49,663
- It's true.
- Yeah, she gets it.

734
01:01:49,746 --> 01:01:52,457
- So, I'm supposed to trust this guy?
- I wouldn't.

735
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:55,127
First, I resent the gender labeling.

736
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,505
Second, you can trust
that we share the same goal.

737
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,007
Really? Which is?

738
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:03,969
Bathurst wants to what,
destroy every living thing on earth?

739
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:05,220
Well, that's gonna ruin

740
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,639
a pretty great party
I've got goin' on here.

741
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:09,641
This guy's out of his mind. Hey...

742
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,813
There's a reason
you didn't bring me here before.

743
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:16,565
- I could die in there.
- Yeah.

744
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,067
Could it work?

745
01:02:21,403 --> 01:02:22,404
It could.

746
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:26,533
But you have a choice, Evan.

747
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,660
No, I don't have a choice.

748
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:33,415
I... I can't let anybody else get hurt
because of what's in my head.

749
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:45,344
All right. Leap-of-faith time.

750
01:02:46,887 --> 01:02:49,306
Let's just do it now
before I change my mind. All right?

751
01:02:50,098 --> 01:02:51,850
Let's go. Turn your machine on.

752
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,602
Ooh. Ready to go for a swim?

753
01:02:53,685 --> 01:02:57,147
- Yes. This is gonna be so fun!
- Just shut up and turn it on.

754
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,504
Prolongs your sense of t/me.

755
01:03:23,256 --> 01:03:26,134
Whatever happens,
don't let them stop until it's done.

756
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,596
He'll hold his breath
as long as he can, and then...

757
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,682
Base instinct takes over.

758
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,366
Twenty-two. Too many.

759
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:35,912
Twenty. No more. And 18.

760
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,183
Oh, my god. He's drowning.

761
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,477
That's the whole idea.

762
01:05:02,606 --> 01:05:05,901
- Maybe we should pull him out.
- He's not there yet. Two more minutes.

763
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,910
Abel, listen to me. If I fail...

764
01:05:19,831 --> 01:05:21,166
Come on.

765
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:22,250
Nora...

766
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:24,294
He's dying.

767
01:05:24,377 --> 01:05:26,379
We're close. We are close.

768
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:32,052
Doesn't have a pulse!

769
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:35,597
Get him out!

770
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:42,813
Come on! Come on.

771
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:55,117
Okay. Okay.

772
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,120
Get out of the way.

773
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:11,842
Come on.

774
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:17,556
He's gone.

775
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:22,185
We killed him.

776
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:49,462
If / fa/I, look inside.

777
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,406
Evan, you're okay. Just breathe.

778
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,050
I am treadway. I am treadway.

779
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:46,603
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

780
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,941
I'm treadway.

781
01:07:54,486 --> 01:07:57,822
If you are treadway, answer this.

782
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:00,867
Do you know where the egg is?

783
01:08:21,304 --> 01:08:22,305
Yes.

784
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,432
- Yes?
- Yes.

785
01:08:25,141 --> 01:08:27,769
Look inside. Look inside.

786
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:33,066
We were trained to think of bodies
as unimportant, right?

787
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:35,318
- Right.
- Just shells meant to be discarded.

788
01:08:36,152 --> 01:08:40,031
Well, treadway knew the one place...
That nobody would look.

789
01:08:55,672 --> 01:08:57,924
Abel? Abel, listen to me.

790
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,135
If I fail, look inside.

791
01:09:00,844 --> 01:09:02,178
It's in his body.

792
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:04,055
Back at the hub.

793
01:09:07,517 --> 01:09:09,644
It's been there the whole time. Come on.

794
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,815
I am shocked that that worked.

795
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,824
I knew it was you the whole time.
That's why I let you win.

796
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:23,950
Oh, you let me, huh?

797
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:27,537
Whoo! I don't know about you guys,
but I could use a drink.

798
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,080
Come on, we don't have time for...

799
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:31,791
Security lockdown!

800
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:38,840
- I'm hit.
- You all right?

801
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:47,015
Hey! Follow me.

802
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:49,934
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Open emergency lift.

803
01:09:54,564 --> 01:09:55,982
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Wait!

804
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,626
Are you crazy? They're about to breach!

805
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:00,737
We're not running, all right?
I'm tired of running.

806
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,239
- I'm gonna fight 'em right now.
- Hang in there, trace.

807
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,080
She's dead.

808
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:11,456
Oh, sh...

809
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:14,167
Guys, we need to leave now.

810
01:10:21,674 --> 01:10:23,676
- I'm staying.
- What?

811
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,303
We stay here, we fight 'em now.

812
01:10:30,183 --> 01:10:32,727
- You're leaking like the Titanic.
- I'm fine.

813
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,688
If you die here, who stops bathurst?

814
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,565
He's right.

815
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:39,692
Hey.

816
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,363
You make this worth it, dziecko.

817
01:10:44,364 --> 01:10:45,740
Then buy me some time.

818
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:48,535
Open weapons room door.

819
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:52,288
Good luck.

820
01:12:05,778 --> 01:12:06,779
Careful, sir.

821
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,491
Oh, I will be.

822
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:18,726
We're taking treadway's body to Scotland.

823
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:19,852
Very well.

824
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:23,064
Keep him alive.

825
01:13:23,147 --> 01:13:26,484
I'll do the best I can,
but he's lost a lot of blood.

826
01:13:28,444 --> 01:13:29,779
The keys are in the car.

827
01:13:53,428 --> 01:13:54,429
Heinrich.

828
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:57,181
Good of you to join us.

829
01:14:00,226 --> 01:14:02,937
I only wish you were here to see this...

830
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:05,982
To understand your...

831
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:09,819
Your role in this.

832
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:18,286
The end of all our debates.

833
01:14:45,855 --> 01:14:48,358
The end of all things.

834
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:54,280
Have it cleaned and tested.

835
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:57,158
Make sure it's the real thing.

836
01:14:57,742 --> 01:14:58,826
Is it really over?

837
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:00,995
Not quite yet.

838
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,082
Never underestimate treadway.

839
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:33,945
You're awake.

840
01:15:34,028 --> 01:15:35,113
Where am I?

841
01:15:35,905 --> 01:15:39,158
I told Nora I'd wait with you
until you woke up.

842
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:42,120
You're in my safe house.

843
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:46,249
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing your morphine!

844
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:50,253
- Where is she?
- Huh? Oh, she went after bathurst.

845
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:52,630
Oh, shit.

846
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,466
She's not doing this alone. No way.

847
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:59,887
Whoa, whoa! Come on, man.

848
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:03,641
You try running out now, you'll bleed out
before you reach the compound.

849
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,436
If we're going down,
we're going down together.

850
01:16:07,395 --> 01:16:09,147
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

851
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:11,274
I just patched you up, man.

852
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:14,360
Let me catch you up
on the current situation.

853
01:16:15,111 --> 01:16:17,321
If bathurst gets his way, we're all done.

854
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:18,865
There's no more second chances.

855
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:21,200
I'm gonna get the egg and kill him.

856
01:16:22,618 --> 01:16:24,162
She told me you were one of us.

857
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:26,330
Obviously, you're just full of shit.

858
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:32,044
Diagnostics are done.
The bomb is ready for the egg.

859
01:16:32,128 --> 01:16:33,755
Have them load it on the plane.

860
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:44,140
Come here, you bastard.

861
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,768
Do you think he'll...

862
01:16:48,227 --> 01:16:49,812
Let us do this?

863
01:16:59,238 --> 01:17:01,073
The end of all things.

864
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,959
Move, move, move! On the rig! Let's go!

865
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,120
Move, move!

866
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:41,043
Dropping in three, two, one.

867
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,893
- Do you need a ride?
- Love one.

868
01:20:59,478 --> 01:21:01,897
- You okay?
- No. Don't ask.

869
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,287
Did you see that?

870
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:20,392
Nora, you okay?

871
01:22:20,476 --> 01:22:21,560
Okay, come on.

872
01:22:22,603 --> 01:22:23,604
I got you.

873
01:22:29,068 --> 01:22:30,444
I'll get you out of here. Come on.

874
01:22:31,695 --> 01:22:32,696
Oh, shit.

875
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,036
You all right? Oh, shit.

876
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,038
Hey. We gotta get you out of here.

877
01:22:49,213 --> 01:22:51,799
- You gonna be okay to move?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

878
01:22:51,882 --> 01:22:52,925
Okay. Come on.

879
01:23:32,798 --> 01:23:35,176
- You gotta go.
- Bathurst is getting away.

880
01:23:35,259 --> 01:23:38,262
His hard drives are here.
I have to destroy them and free them all.

881
01:23:39,513 --> 01:23:40,806
I'll see you again.

882
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:26,745
We'll be landing in Glasgow
in 16 minutes, sir.

883
01:25:27,913 --> 01:25:28,914
Stay low.

884
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:32,001
Use tfr.

885
01:25:35,796 --> 01:25:36,797
Oh, my god.

886
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:42,052
Come on. Come on.

887
01:25:48,142 --> 01:25:49,351
They're all here.

888
01:25:50,352 --> 01:25:51,562
All the souls.

889
01:25:52,646 --> 01:25:53,897
We have to free them all.

890
01:25:57,526 --> 01:25:59,236
Nora. Nora, hey. Hey.

891
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,406
Stay with me, okay? We are so close.

892
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,367
Let's blow some shit up, huh?

893
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:28,349
Shit!

894
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:30,642
We've lost engine three, sir.

895
01:26:38,609 --> 01:26:40,129
We're gonna have to land the aircraft.

896
01:26:48,327 --> 01:26:50,454
What the hell are you doing? Sir!

897
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:00,547
Please. You're gonna crash
the aircraft. Sir!

898
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:08,866
It's impossible.

899
01:28:10,242 --> 01:28:11,994
I-Impossible.

900
01:28:23,672 --> 01:28:25,192
He's opened the bloody top hatch, sir.

901
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:18,644
You disappoint me.

902
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,814
No recognition whatsoever, huh?

903
01:29:23,857 --> 01:29:25,108
I think I should feel hurt.

904
01:29:27,069 --> 01:29:30,155
Car crash? Steel plate, remember?

905
01:31:48,919 --> 01:31:51,463
Treadway, you can't deactivate it!

906
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:54,257
It's happening!

907
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:14,421
Death isn't the end. Not for us.

908
01:33:15,005 --> 01:33:16,673
Maybe not for any of us.

909
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,050
New chapter, same story.

910
01:33:20,969 --> 01:33:22,304
I can carry you out.

911
01:33:22,888 --> 01:33:24,139
No way.

912
01:33:24,723 --> 01:33:25,724
I'll free them.

913
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:28,435
Here.

914
01:33:31,813 --> 01:33:33,690
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

915
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:49,122
I'll find you in the beginn/ng.

916
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:50,373
I love you.

917
01:34:08,767 --> 01:34:10,268
I ask myself ..

918
01:34:11,353 --> 01:34:13,605
What did being Evan ll/lccau/e y teach me?

919
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,657
If each new life is a chance
to build on what was,

920
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,618
a chance to press forward
to the best of what could be...

921
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,621
Go, go, go!

922
01:34:30,497 --> 01:34:33,542
Why will some of us have to pick up
the sword and fight aga/n...

923
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:49,266
Wh/le others discover a new beginn/ng?

924
01:35:02,779 --> 01:35:03,780
Nora?

925
01:35:12,581 --> 01:35:15,458
It's hope. That's whatl learned

926
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:18,962
yes, we fall. Yes, we fa/I.

927
01:35:19,045 --> 01:35:21,715
Yes, sometimes we screw up
everything we touch.

928
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:24,426
But each moment we live
is connected by a belief

929
01:35:24,509 --> 01:35:29,764
that the actions we take
will next day, next week, next life

930
01:35:29,848 --> 01:35:31,641
add up to something more,

931
01:35:31,725 --> 01:35:33,935
something bigger than yourself

932
01:35:50,493 --> 01:35:54,039
And next... well, the possrbil/ties are...

933
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,041
Infinite.

934
01:37:09,572 --> 01:37:13,284
When your son starts asking questions
about his past,

935
01:37:13,368 --> 01:37:14,369
give me a call.

936
01:37:24,212 --> 01:37:26,339
He says he's just a child.

937
01:37:26,923 --> 01:37:27,966
What about your sword?

938
01:37:29,551 --> 01:37:32,220
That's not my sword. It's his.

939
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:39,936
Artisan, what took you so long?

940
01:37:40,854 --> 01:37:42,147
See you soon, treadway.
